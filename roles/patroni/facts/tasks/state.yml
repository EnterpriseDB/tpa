# These facts are set conditionally based on the state of the cluster.
# This is called once at the start of a deployment during the TPA init phase,
# and again once a new cluster has been initialised.

# When a new cluster is created using TPA and Patroni is selected as the fail-over
# manager, and patroni has not been initialised (no existing state is present in
# the DCS), TPA will:
#
# 1. Create a single standalone PostgreSQL server using the same method that
#   it does for other cluster types and fail-over managers. TPA will create
#   configuration files, initialise the database, start the server with the
#   `postgres` systemd service unit configured with TPA, establish what users
#   should be created, add extension configuration, etc.
# 2. create a Patroni configuration with bootstrap settings that will initialise
#   the DCS with settings and PostgreSQL configuration generated and provided by
#   TPA.
# 3. start Patroni on the primary node, where Patroni will populate the DCS with
#   configuration from the bootstrap configuration in the Patroni config file,
#   read the state of the database, and promote itself to be the leader.
# 4. start Patroni on secondary nodes, that will connect to the DCS and see
#   there is an existing cluster, establishing a connection with the primary
#   and perform replica creation.
# 5. detect the Patroni cluster is initialised and perform any clean up that is
#   required, including removing configuration files for PostgreSQL laid down by
#   TPA in step 1 above.
#
# Once a cluster has been deployed, subsequent `deploy` runs with TPA will:
#
# 1. detect that Patroni is initialised, disabling the creation of PostgreSQL
#  configuration files and management of postgres systemd service.
# 2. compare configuration supplied via TPA `config.yml` with the contents of
#  Patroni configuration YAML and stage a reload of the Patroni daemon if needed.
# 3. compare configuration with the contents of the DCS by calling the Patroni
#  API endpoint, and schedule an update if needed. If a restart of PostgreSQL
#  is needed this will be handled by Patroni, TPA will send a request to the
#  Patroni API endpoint requesting it to do this if it thinks it is needed,
#  because for example it detected a change previously.
#
# The automation here should allow for a Patroni cluster to be managed both from
# the host using `patronictl` command line interface or via the Patroni API.
# However, TPA remains the source of truth and will overwrite configuration
# clashes if they exist.
