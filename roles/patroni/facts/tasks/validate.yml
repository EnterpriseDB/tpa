    fail_msg: >
      Patroni as a failover manager is incompatible with a custom `postgres_conf_template`

    fail_msg: >
      Patroni as a failover manager is incompatible with the setting `postgres_data_dir` due
      to the way Patroni manages Postgres configuration. Please migrate all Postgres settings
      to config.yml options and/or `postgres_conf_settings`.

  assert:
    that:
      not (platform == 'docker' and patroni_watchdog_enabled|default(false))
