# This service call should not handle restart, this is because it will also shut down postgres
# when patroni stops. It is fine for a `reload` to occur through the systemd unit as the daemon
# performs the same action for a SIGHUP as it does via a `patronictl reload` and via the /reload
# API. A stop call should only be fired when Patroni is paused, so we avoid failovers.
