# On a new cluster we start by creating the Postgres cluster before
# patroni, at this stage the DCS has no info about the cluster
# but the configuration should be defined. Patroni is able to use
# the existing initialised database and config, and create a new
# DCS config.

# So first of all we read the cluster state from the DCS, then we
# start patroni on the primary if the DCS is empty. This ensures that the
# expected Postgres node is set as leader in the DCS. Then once the DCS has
# correct information we can start Patroni on the standbys who will be
# assigned with the correct role in the DCS (`replica`)

# Make Patroni take management over on the primary
# We need to start with the primary so we avoid that Patroni would promote a
# replica when taking over the cluster management
