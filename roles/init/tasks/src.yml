# Set a global boolean fact based on whether any installation method has
# 'src', rather than checking specific `*_installation_method` vars by
# name later.

# The `_installation_methods` var first matches any hostvars key with the
# pattern `installation_method`. It then extracts the values for those
# keys from hostvars for the host. The resultant list will contain a
# number of 'src' strings for each match. Finally, the value of the fact
# will be true if the list contains the 'src' string.

# This gives us a single boolean fact if any installation method is 'src'
