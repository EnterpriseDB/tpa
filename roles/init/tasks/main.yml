# We attempt to gather postgres facts only if there is a valid PGDATA
# directory, the postgres user exists, and postgres is running; or in
# other words, only if we have a reasonable chance of being able to
# connect to Postgres. At this early stage of deployment, it is not an
# error if these conditions are not met (e.g., when we are attaching an
# existing PGDATA to a new instance).
