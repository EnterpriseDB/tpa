# We have the following package sources available to us:
#
# 1. Repositories defined in {apt,yum}_repositories and listed in
#    {apt,yum}_repository_list (to activate the definitions). This
#    includes PGDG, EPEL, EDB Repos 1.0, and any extra user-defined
#    repositories. If you want to use the EDB repo, you must have an
#    EDB_REPO_CREDENTIALS_FILE.
#
# 2. Repositories listed in tpa_2q_repositories, which may be empty. We
#    need a TPA_2Q_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN to access these repositories,
#    except for dl/default/release, which is open to everyone.
#
# 3. Repositories listed in edb_repositories, which may be empty. We
#    always need an EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN to access these repositories.
#    This is the preferred mechanism for new clusters, and everything we
#    need for PGD5 should come from them, but apart from that, everyone
#    does not have access to them yet (so we must use older repositories
#    in those cases).
#
# In principle, we want config.yml to spell out exactly which of these
# sources to use in any given cluster. However, must maintain backwards
# compatibility with decisions we've made in the past to implicitly add
# repositories in certain circumstances.
