# We must find a backend instance that pgbouncer points to, so that we
# can check if vars['pgbouncer_auth_user_password'] is up-to-date when
# compared to roles['pgbouncer_auth_user'].rolpassword from
# hostvars[backend].cluster_facts.
#
# If pgbouncer_backend is 127.0.0.1, we substitute inventory_hostname.
# If the result is in hostvars and is a Postgres instance, we're done.
# Otherwise, if it's an haproxy instance, we can use the first of its
# haproxy_backend_servers. That's as far as we can reasonably go.
