# An EC2 instance in a VPC will always have a private IP address. It may
# also have a public IP address (which may or may not be an elastic IP).

# to an elastic IP, or if one does not exist, the public IP, or if that
# doesn't exist either, the private IP.
#
# Here we enumerate the available ip_addresses (so that we can generate
# an appropriate known_hosts, for example) and pick a default address to
# use within the cluster.
