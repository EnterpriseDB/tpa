# First, we run the following in the postgres database:
#
# 1. pgbench -i on every primary (in parallel)
# 2. An r/w workload on every primary (in parallel)
# 3. An r/o workload on every replica (in parallel)
#
# This gives us baseline numbers for per-instance performance with only
# Postgres and streaming replication in the picture.

- include_tasks:
    file: pgbench-postgres.yml
    apply:
      tags: [pgbench, postgres]
  vars:
    pgbench_dbname: postgres

# Next, for BDR instances, we run the following in the BDR-enabled
# database:
#
# 1. pgbench -i on one (arbitrary) primary
# 2. bdr.wait_slot_confirm_lsn() on EVERY instance
# 3. An r/w workload on one (preferably different) primary
# 4. An r/o workload on every replica (in parallel)
#
# The above steps are done in parallel for every bdr_node_group in the
# cluster (but there's usually only one of those).

- include_tasks:
    file: pgbench-bdr.yml
    apply:
      tags: [pgbench, bdr]
