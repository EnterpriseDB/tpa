# We want to call this repmgrd.service, but there's a systemd bug (at
# least on Debian 8) that prevents us from overriding the unit that is
# created by the late generator from /etc/init.d/repmgrd. Using a name
# that doesn't conflict is the easiest workaround.
#
# repmgr 4.1.0 introduces daemonization by default and introduces a new
# non-backwards compatible option to turn it off, so we have to work around it
