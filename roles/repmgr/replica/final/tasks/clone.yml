# Now we have to decide where to clone from.
#
# The obvious answer is our 'upstream' instance, which may be a primary
# or another replica. The problem is that if it's a replica, it may not
# have been initialised yet. We check if we can connect to the upstream
# and if so, clone from it; if not, we clone from the primary and do a
# little magic to make the replication work as desired afterwards.
