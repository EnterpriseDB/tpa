# TODO
#
# If we just started Postgres, we waited until it reached a consistent
# recovery point and started accepting connections (postgres-monitor),
# but it may still be performing archive recovery and not have started
# streaming, so we can't just fail if pg_stat_wal_receiver is empty.
#
# We should check if primary_slot_name is configured and, if so, check
# that the correct upstream instance actually has a slot by that name.
# This is not straightforward, because we may not have initialised the
# correct upstream instance yet.
