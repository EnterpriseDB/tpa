# We use the apt cache to extract Depends and PreDepends packages
# filtering out other types of association like Recommends and Suggests.
# Additionally, the recurse option follows all dependency trees
# including virtual packages.
#
# Any remaining virtual packages in the list and indented lines are
# excluded, the list is sorted and duplicates removed.
#
# The final output contains packages that we need to download.

# and download the rest of the output from the dependency resolution,
# plus the original package list, which has been modified to include
# specific versions if it contained wildcards. This merged list may
# contain duplicates but that doesn't cause a problem.
