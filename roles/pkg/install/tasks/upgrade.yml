# Because pkg/install was invoked with `allow_package_upgrades` set, we
# have license to set `state: latest` for packages we are installing.
#
# We must still use `state: present` for packages with explicit version
# specifications (i.e., xxx_package_version is set), because we'll get
# an error with `state: latest`. If an older version is installed, the
# package will be upgraded anyway with `state: present`.
#
# Packages with version specifications look like `xxx=1.2.3` (Debian) or
# `yyy-2.3.4` (RedHat). We don't deal with any non-alphanumeric version
# specifications in tpaexec, so the regex below doesn't consider those.
#
# This mode does not support dry runs.
