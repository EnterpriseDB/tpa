# We need credentials to clone repositories if we are to build things
# from source:
#
# 1. For repositories with ssh:// URLs, add the relevant keys to your
#    ssh-agent and use agent forwarding. ``--install-from-source`` will
#    set ``forward_ssh_agent: yes`` by default in config.yml, which will
#    add ``-o ForwardAgent=yes`` to ansible_ssh_common_args, and the SSH
#    agent socket will be made available to git-clone.
#
# 2. If your source repositories all use https:// URLs pointing to the
#    same server (e.g., github.com), you can set
#    ``TPA_GIT_CREDENTIALS=username:access_token`` in your environment
#    before executing tpaexec. The credentials will be made available to
#    git-clone only (they will never be written to disk, but will be set
#    in the environment on target instances).
#
# 3. If you set ``TPA_GIT_CREDENTIAL_STORE=/path/to/.gitcredentials`` in
#    your environment before executing tpaexec, it will copy the given
#    git-credential-store(1) file to the target instances. This allows
#    you to use different credentials for different https:// repository
#    URLs, at the expense of writing the credentials to disk. We make an
#    attempt to remove the file after cloning the repositories, but this
#    will succeed only if none of the intervening tasks fail.
#
# If none of the above options will work for you, use a pre-deploy hook
# to configure some other credential retrieval mechanism.

# If TPA_GIT_CREDENTIALS_STORE is set, it takes precedence over setting
# TPA_GIT_CREDENTIALS (handled below).
