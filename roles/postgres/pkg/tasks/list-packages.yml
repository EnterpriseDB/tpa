# On Postgres 9.5, pgespresso is required to support rsync-based backups
# from a replica. (To do so, we also have to create the extension on the
# corresponding primary, which we don't do by default yet, because the
# extension has known crash-the-server problems.)
#
# By default, we always install pglogical packages (if it's not being
# installed from source), unless it's not supported (e.g., with BDRv4).
# On BDR instances, we must also install BDR packages (again, if it's
# not being installed from source).
