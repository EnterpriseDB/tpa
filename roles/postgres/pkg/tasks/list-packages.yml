# On Postgres 9.5, pgespresso is required to support rsync-based backups
# from a replica. (To do so, we also have to create the extension on the
# corresponding primary, which we don't do by default yet, because the
# extension has known crash-the-server problems.)
#
# We always install pglogical (if it's not being installed from source),
# and on BDR instances, we also install BDR packages (again, if it's not
# being installed from source).
