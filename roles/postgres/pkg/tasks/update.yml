# The BDR4 packages are meant to replace (not coexist with) BDR3 and
# pglogical3 packages. The BDR4 package dependencies do reflect this,
# and we should be able to install them and have the package manager
# remove the older packages. Unfortunately, the Postgres and Postgres
# Extended builds of BDR3/pglogical3 both use the same package names,
# and declare the same (Postgres) dependencies, and the package manager
# can't choose between the multiple available upgrade paths, so we have
# to remove BDR3/pglogical3 explicitly before installing BDR4.
