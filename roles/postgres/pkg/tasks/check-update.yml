# The purpose of this check is to warn the user as early as possible if
# they are missing any packages that we would try to install during an
# upgrade window.
#
# Unfortunately, with the way RPM package dependencies work, if new bdr5
# packages ARE present, the check fails with a "Depsolve Error", which
# tells us only that bdr5 packages conflict with the bdr4 ones. That's
# not actually an error, and we shouldn't bother the user with it.
