# At the moment, however, package installation is not distribution
# specific. This can be moved into os/ if that ever changes.

# We also install the python-psycopg2 package (because we need it to use
# Ansible's postgresql_* modules). If we install Postgres from source—or
# can't satisfy the python-psycopg2 package dependencies for some other
# reason—we'll need to "pip install psycopg2" after adding pgbindir to
# PATH (because pg_config is not always in PATH).
