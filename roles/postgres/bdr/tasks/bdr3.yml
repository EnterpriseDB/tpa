# The remaining hosts join the group… but they must do so one at a time,
# because BDR does not support concurrent group joins (not in version 3,
# nor in any earlier versions).
#
# What we would like to do here is to set «serial: 1» on the query task,
# so that we wait for the task to finish on one host before moving on to
# the next host. But serial is not supported as a task attribute, so we
# have to (write a strategy plugin or) use a loop to get the equivalent
# serial behaviour.
