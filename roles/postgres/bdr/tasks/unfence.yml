  # When "harpctl get node" shows that the node is no longer fenced, we
  # can be reasonably sure that the DCS is healthy. If we're using etcd,
  # we don't know that BDR consensus has also been re-established, but
  # the node-by-node upgrade process will wait for that already after
  # this step, so we don't check here.

  # XXX We don't know how long writing the node information to the DCS
  # will actually take in a production cluster. Maybe it will behave
  # differently depending on whether we're using etcd or bdr. We should
  # consult with the HARP developers to decide on the appropriate number
  # of retries/delay.
