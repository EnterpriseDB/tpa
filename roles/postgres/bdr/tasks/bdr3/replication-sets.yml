# Replication set configuration:
#
# - publication_sets defines the replication sets that must exist (these
# are configured on the first_bdr_primary and replicated to other nodes)
# - subscription_sets defines the replication sets that each node wants
# to subscribe to
#
# (We handle these together because we want to alter node subscriptions
# before dropping unsed replication sets from publications.)
#
# The first_bdr_primary will now fetch existing replication sets and
# create or alter replication sets to match publication_sets.

- include_tasks: bdr3/replication-set-define.yml
  when:
    inventory_hostname == first_bdr_primary

# Now each node can check and alter, if required, which replication sets
# it subscribes to. We must always subscribe to the default replication
# set for the group, because DDL replication won't work otherwise. Note
# that the first time this happens is before the group join.
