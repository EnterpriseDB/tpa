# We are here because this instance has role bdr+primary (as opposed to
# bdr+replica, which is a read-only streaming replica of a bdr+primary
# node). BDR packages have been installed, shared_preload_libraries
# contains 'bdr', BDR configuration has been installed, and the BDR
# extension has been created (in template1).
#
# First, each node needs a BDR database.

- name: Create BDR database
  postgresql_db:
    port: "{{ postgres_port }}"
    name: "{{ bdr_database }}"
    owner: "{{ postgres_user }}"
    state: present
  become_user: "{{ postgres_user }}"
  become: yes

# Next, we need to decide which flavour of BDR we're working with.
#
# BDR1: BDR-Postgres 9.4 only
# BDR2: BDR-Postgres 9.4, plus
#       {,2ndQ}Postgres 9.6
# BDR3: {,2ndQ}Postgres 10 only

#
# We don't try to second-guess the decision taken by postgres/pkg about
# which versions of Postgres and BDR to install. We just detect what is
# available and do our best to work with it. Things will break if the
# installed combination is not sensible.
#
# Note: unfortunately, there do exist versions of BDR that do not have
# bdr_version_num(), but we choose not to support them, as they are of
# little or no practical importance (e.g., no customers use them).

- name: Retrieve BDR version
  postgresql_query:
    conninfo: '{{ bdr_node_dsn }}'
    query: >-
      SELECT bdr.bdr_version_num() AS num, bdr.bdr_version() AS version
  register: bdr_version
  become_user: "{{ postgres_user }}"

# Now one node must create a BDR group, and the other nodes must join
# the group. It doesn't matter which node creates the group, so long as
# all the nodes make the same decision about which one should create it.
#
# We set the "bdr_node_group" host var for every node (in config.yml),
# so we can use that value to create a new Ansible inventory group of
# the nodes with the same value of bdr_node_group. Then we pick the
# first node in the host group to create the BDR group.
#
# There are two points to note here:
#
# 1. The common case is that all of the bdr+primary nodes have the same
#    value for bdr_node_group; we will create a single group containing
#    all of these nodes.
#
#    However, if some nodes have different values of bdr_node_group, we
#    will create multiple groups here, but each node looks at the group
#    based on its own value of bdr_node_group, so we can set up disjoint
#    BDR groups in parallel if necessary.
#
# 2. BDR1/BDR2 do not actually support group names, but we require that
#    all nodes that are intended to belong to the same BDR group have
#    the same value set for bdr_node_group (to enable the behaviour
#    described above). The name just isn't used for anything else.
