# Now we have to decide where to clone from.
#
# The obvious answer is our 'upstream' instance, which may be a primary
# or another replica. The problem is that if it's a replica, it may not
# have been initialised yet. We check if we can connect to the upstream
# and if so, clone from it; if not, we clone from the primary and do a
# little magic to make the replication work as desired afterwards.
#
# pg_basebackup will use a temporary replication slot, and we'll create
# the correct persistent replication slots on the (primary or replica)
# upstream instances after we start Postgres on them. The guard slot we
# created in postgres/config/final ensures that we don't lose any WAL in
# between.
