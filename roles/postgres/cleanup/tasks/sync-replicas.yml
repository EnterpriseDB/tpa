# If synchronous_standby_names is specified, we must generate a separate
# config file that contains only this setting (and reload Postgres when
# the setting changes).
#
# This isn't exactly a "cleanup", but we can't do it in postgres/config
# because the setting may depend on the existence of replicas that have
# not yet been cloned during the initial deployment; but we can be sure
# the replicas are working by the time we reach the cleanup stage.
#
# (This does not apply to BDR instances; see postgres-reconfig.yml for
# their special-case handling of synchronous_standby_names.)
