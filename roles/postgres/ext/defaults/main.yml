## What should we build?
#
# We take a git repository URL to clone and a reference to checkout. An
# optional local reference repository can be specified to save bandwidth
# and time. There is no default: you must specify a repository.

postgres_ext_git_url: ""
postgres_ext_git_ref: master
postgres_ext_git_reference_repo: ""

## Build location
#
# We clone the repository specified above into the ext_dir given here.
# The build settings and install location are determined by pg_config
# (which must be in the PATH).
#
# You can use "--skip-tags postgres-ext-clean" to avoid re-creating the
# ext_dir from scratch each time.

postgres_ext_dir: /opt/postgres/build-ext

## Build customisation
#
# We run "make install" by default, but you can specify other targets
# and additional make options here if required.

postgres_ext_make_command: "make"
postgres_ext_make_opts:
  - USE_PGXS=1
postgres_ext_targets:
  - "install"
