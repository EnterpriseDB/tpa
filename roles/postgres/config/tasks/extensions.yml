# Here we install any configuration required for the extensions to be
# installed. The "CREATE EXTENSION" commands will be issued later, via
# postgres/config/final. The list of postgres_extensions was determined
# earlier in roles/facts.

# We install a default configuration for the extensions we care about.
# We don't need to have conditional logic in this template, because the
# configuration will be ignored if we aren't installing a particular
# extension after all.
