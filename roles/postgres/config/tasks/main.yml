# This role is applied to every postgres instance with a valid PGDATA.
#
# We aspire to the following configuration layout:
#
# postgres_data_dir/
#   pg_hba.conf
#   postgresql.conf
#   conf.d/
#     0000-tpa.conf
#     0001-tpa_restart.conf
#     1111-extensions.conf
#     8888-{{ variable_name }}*.conf
#     9900-role-settings.conf
#     9999-override.conf
#
# On every instance, we create pg_hba.conf and postgresql.conf, make the
# latter include conf.d, and create the various files inside conf.d. On
# a replica, the configuration will be cloned from a primary, and then
# updated with any values specific to the instance.
#
# Although it is possible to set up pg_hba.conf differently on different
# instances, any such differences may interfere with switchover/failover
# operations, and should be avoided.

- include_tasks: defaults.yml

# First, we generate pg_hba.conf. There are several options here:
#
# 1. You can leave the existing pg_hba.conf alone. To do this, just set
#    postgres_hba_template to '' explicitly.
# 2. You can set postgres_hba_template to 'pg_hba.lines.j2' and specify
#    an array of lines in postgres_hba_settings; then pg_hba.conf will
#    contain the lines you specify, and no other rules.
# 3. The default postgres_hba_template 'pg_hba.conf.j2' will generate a
#    sensible configuration for the cluster. Any extra lines you specify
#    in postgres_hba_settings will be appended to these defaults.
# 4. You can set postgres_hba_template to something else and do whatever
#    you want in the custom template.

  tags: [postgres, hba]

# Next, we generate postgresql.conf if the caller specifies a template.
# Otherwise, we leave the default postgresql.conf alone. Any changes to
# this file require a Postgres restart, because we don't know what might
# have been changed.

# No matter where the config file lives (and where it came from), we
# make it include a config dir in PGDATA.

# not require a postgres restart.

# If any settings were specified in postgres_conf_settings, we put that
