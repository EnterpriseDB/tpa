# That should be enough, right? Alas, no. The PGDG RPMs install a
# .bash_profile, which has priority over .profile. We could overwrite
# it, but a comment says we run the risk of a future update overwriting
# our changes:
#
#   «If you want to customize your settings,
#   Use the file below. This is not overridden
#   by the RPMS.»
#
# This comment is followed by a bafflingly commented-out line:
#
# #[ -f /var/lib/pgsql/.pgsql_profile ] && source /var/lib/pgsql/.pgsql_profile"
#
# So if you follow the advice and put your settings in .pgsql_profile,
# you would still have to uncomment that line; and when you do so, you
# become vulnerable to upstream changes again. Six of one, half a dozen
# of the other. We don't engage in the contortions required to cope with
# this odd scheme. If a .bash_profile exists at all, we'll just make it
# read our .bashrc.
