# We must install the PEM packages and generate some configuration files
# on any instance that includes 'pem-server' in its role. (Any such PEM
# server must also be a Postgres instance; but the Postgres config will
# be handled separately as for any other instance.)

    name: pem/server
    apply:
      tags: pem-server
  when: >
    'pem-server' in role
  tags: always

# An instance with `pem_server` set to the name of a pem-server instance
# will be monitored by that PEM server. We added 'pem-agent' to the role
# for such instances earlier (in platforms/common). Now we must install
# the PEM agent on these instances.

- include_role:
    name: pem/agent
    apply:
      tags: pem-agent
  when: >
    'pem-agent' in role
  tags: always

# The rest of the configuration for both PEM server and its agent(s) can
# be done only after Postgres is running (see pem/final).
