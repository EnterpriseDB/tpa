# If we're working with PEM 10.1 or newer (that's what 'above_pem10_1' tells

# connection strings, and the port could be part of that text. For the older
# PEM versions, just letting it be a number is fine.
#
# Quick note: TPA itself isn't setting up those multi-host PEM things yet, but
# we're making sure the port format is what PEM expects for these newer
