## Packages
#
# We define three hashes of package lists here.
#
# 1. Required packages, installed all together.
# 2. Optional packages, installed one by one (failures are ignored).
# 3. Unwanted packages, which should not be installed at all.
#
# Within each hash is a 'common' list (packages that have the same name
# in all supported distributions) and one list against the name of each
# distribution (for packages specific to that distribution).
#
# There are two versions of each hash, e.g., default_packages and
# packages. We define the defaults, and the caller may define any
# additional packages in the same format.
#
# For convenience, all these lists are flattened before use.
