# The first time we reach here on a new instance, we know only what
# distribution it is running, but we take nothing else for granted,
# including the presence of a usable Python interpreter.
#
# We invoke sys/bootstrap to check whether the basic requirements are
# satisfied, and install them otherwise; but instances without outside
# network access can't install anything that's missing, so we invoke
# sys/local_repo first (in such an environment, the local-repo must
# provide all packages required during deployment).

# Now that all instances have a source of packages (either the network
# or the local-repo), we can check what's missing and install it. After
# this stage, we can run any Ansible modules we need.

# that can run after this point, make sure the default or user selected
# locale is available.
