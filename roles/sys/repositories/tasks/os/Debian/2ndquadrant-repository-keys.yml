# To use 2ndQuadrant repositories after March 2020, it was necessary to
# have the 2ndquadrant-repository-keys package installed. That package
# created the directory /usr/share/2ndquadrant-repository-keys. We used to
# install the package here if it wasn't already installed; however, as
# the 2ndQuadrant repositories are being retired, installing the package
# is no longer supported. So if you haven't redeployed since before March
# 2020, you will now be unable to use 2ndQuadrant repositories at all.
