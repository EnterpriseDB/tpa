# 2ndQuadrant sent out a Tech alert on 2020-03-11 that informed users of
# an "Update to 2ndQuadrant Debian/Ubuntu Repositories Required".
#
# The GPG keys used to authenticate packages from the 2ndQuadrant Debian
# and apt repositories were about to expire. We recommended installing
# the 2ndquadrant-repository-keys package to keep the keys up-to-date.
#
# The keys have now expired, so for existing clusters without the new
# keys, the first apt-get update would fail because of unauthenticated
# repositories (so this can't be fixed in a pre-deploy hook). So if we
# find that 2ndquadrant-repository-keys is not installed and there are
# any 2ndQuadrant repositories configured, we install the new package.
