# We configure a service named openvpn-server@xyz on the openvpn server,
# and a service named openvpn-client@xyz on each of the openvpn clients.
# But existing clusters will have a service named openvpn@xyz on both
# server and clients, and it's not worth changing the configuration
# layout (which would require a restart) in that case.
