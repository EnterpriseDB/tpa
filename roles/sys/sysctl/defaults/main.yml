# The caller may supply sysctl_values, which will be merged with the
# sysctl_defaults values described below:
#
# zone_reclaim_mode should be disabled by default, but make sure anyway.
#
# When we accumulate more than 256MB of dirty pages, we want to start
# writing them out in the background; writes should become synchronous
# when we accumulate more than 4GB of dirty pages. Regardless of volume,
# dirty pages should be written out every 10s at most.
#
# nr_hugepages is the size of shared_buffers plus 3% of total RAM,
# divided by the size of a huge page (2MB on x86).
