## This support for setting up swap on a disk was moved here
## from XL scripts. Needs review and some possible improvements
## when/if used elsewhere and for production purposes.

# TODO: We should probably set swappiness as well

# Given a block device name, does everything required
# to make the volume available for swap immediately and
# after subsequent reboots.
