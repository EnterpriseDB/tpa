# We pre-generate /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts to allow ssh between cluster

# for some reason we do not have known host keys for the instances.

# (We used to build up known-hosts on each instance using ssh-keyscan,
# but the first significant XL deployments showed that this was far too
# slow. Generating the file locally is the only approach with acceptable
# performance for more than a couple of instances.)
