# Use with caution.

# This role runs "apt-get dist-upgrade" or "yum update" to upgrade all
# packages to the latest available versions, and may involve stopping
# and restarting arbitrary services.
#
# It's meant to be used from clusters/images when building new images,
# and is probably not a good idea to include in any "normal" playbook.
