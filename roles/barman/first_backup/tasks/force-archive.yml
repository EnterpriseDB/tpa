# Having convinced ourselves that we're streaming, we force a switch to
# a new WAL segment to give the archiver something to do. We could use
# «barman switch-xlog --archive», but that doesn't work on replicas, so
# we run pg_switch_xlog() on the instance or its upstream.

# Now we have the name of the WAL segment file corresponding to the LSN
# returned by pg_switch_xlog(), and we must wait for it to be archived.
# First, pg_receivexlog will rename streaming/$n.partial to …/$n. Then
# «barman archive-wal» will move it from streaming/ to wals/. We could
# wait for the file to show up in streaming/ and invoke archive-wal to
# archive the segment immediately, but that would be in a race against
# any archive-wal that is invoked by «barman cron». So the file may be
# moved away from streaming/ before we notice it. Instead, we wait for
# the file to appear in wals/. This isn't racy, but it does depend on
# the unpredictable cron invocation of archive-wal.
