# We force an immediate backup of any instance for which we configured
# backups on this run. Barman will not start a backup until the server
# has archived at least one WAL segment, so we try to make sure that
# happens before we try.

# barman/final should have started pg_receivexlog (via barman cron). We
# check by looking for the corresponding entries in pg_stat_replication
# and pg_replication_slots. We know we ran barman cron, so we don't wait
# for the full minute that cron could potentially take to run it.

# Force a WAL segment switch and wait for the old segment to be archived

# replica, this is equivalent to running pg_switch_wal() on the primary
# and then running barman switch-wal --archive with Barman >= 2.5).
