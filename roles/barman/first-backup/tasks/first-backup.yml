# We force an immediate backup of any instance for which we configured
# backups on this run. Barman will not start a backup until the server
# has archived at least one WAL segment, so we try to make sure that
# happens before we try.

# barman/final should have started pg_receivexlog (via barman cron). We
# check by looking for the corresponding entries in pg_stat_replication
# and pg_replication_slots. We know we ran barman cron, so we don't wait
# for the full minute that cron could potentially take to run it.

# Force a WAL segment switch and wait for the old segment to be archived
# (on a primary, this is equivalent to barman switch-wal --archive; on a
# replica, this is equivalent to running pg_switch_wal() on the primary
# and then running barman switch-wal --archive with Barman >= 2.5).

# Barman 2.8 removes any WAL older than the first backup, so right after
# we take the first backup, there's a window during which "barman check"
# fails because there is no archived WAL, and we have to wait for a new
# segment to be archived before we can take another backup. We can work
# around this by forcing a segment switch after the first backup. Then
# we can take more backups without worrying about race conditions.
#
# Note that "have_backups" is still the value we originally computed,
# and it's now off-by-one because we've completed one backup.

# Barman will force a WAL segment switch itself when taking backups from
# a primary. Otherwise we do it, so that the backup will (eventually) go
# from WAITING_FOR_WALS to DONE (in Barman >= 2.5 terminology).
