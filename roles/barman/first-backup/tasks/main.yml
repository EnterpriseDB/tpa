# We force an immediate backup for any instances that do not have any
# backups at all.
#
# We set minimum_redundancy to 3 by default, so we'll take up to three
# backups (with a nearly empty database) to silence barman check (run
# during tpaexec test). We won't try to take more than three backups,
# and we do that only if there are no backups to begin with (i.e., we
# won't always try to make up the difference between have_backups and
# want_backups).
