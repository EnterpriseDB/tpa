# Barman's version-parsing code can get into trouble with 2ndQPostgres
# version strings. For example, if pg_receivewal --version returns the
# following string:
#
# pg_receivewal (PostgreSQL) 11.1 (2ndQPG 11.1r1.4) (Debian 2:11.1r2ndq1.4~git150.g805a872-1.stretch+1)
#
# Barman will refuse to start pg_receivewal altogether:
#
#       pg_receivexlog compatible: FAILED (PostgreSQL version: 11.1, pg_receivexlog version: 2:11.1r2ndq1.4~git150.g805a872-1.stretch+1))
#
# The only workaround available is to install a command wrapper that
# produces pared-down --version output.
