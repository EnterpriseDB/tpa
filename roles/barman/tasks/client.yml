# These tasks are executed on any instance that needs to be backed up.
#
# Backups for an instance are configured in /etc/barman.d/name.conf on
# the designated backup server. When we first set up backups, we must
# set active=false (which we do in a separate file) and then activate
# the backups in barman/final.
#
# We also need to handle the special case of detaching /var/lib/barman
# from a working instance and attaching it to a new instance, where we
# would have /var/lib/barman/name but not /etc/barman.d/name.conf.
