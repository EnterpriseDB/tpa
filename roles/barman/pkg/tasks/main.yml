# Normally, installing the package creates the group and user and home
# and log directories, but we may need to create them ourselves for a
# source installation, or if barman_{user,group} have been changed.

# For shared Barman servers, users can set `barman_shared: true` in instance
# vars for the barman instance included as the shared barman instace. It
# assumes that the cluster that deploys and managed barman instance itself
# does not set `barman_shared: true`. This helps prevent an usermod issue due
# to the fact that the Barman user already has processes running
# from previous deployments.
