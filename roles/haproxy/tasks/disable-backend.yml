# We want to set this server into the MAINT state in haproxy, which
# disables health checks and prevents new connections to the server
# (it does not terminate existing connections, as the documentation
# indirectly suggests). This is equivalent to "disable server".
#
# We would also like to know if the server was active, so that we can
# take some additional steps below. Unfortunately, there is no way to
# do this in a single step.
#
# We can tell if haproxy is directing traffic to a server by looking
# for an entry with server_id=NNN in the stick table for the backend
# ("show table be"). To make sense of the server_ids, we need to look
# at the server state ("show servers state be"). If we then switch to
# MAINT, we can parse the output to figure out if the server had been
# receiving traffic before the switch.
#
# We assume that pgbouncer is connecting to haproxy on the same host,
# so we send "show table be key 127.0.0.1" to find only the relevant
# entry in the stick table.
#
# This is not resilient against changes to the traffic routing because
# of failed health checks during the process. The best we can do is to
# minimise the window of opportunity for problems by issuing all three
# commands in one go.
#
# Note: I have not been able to find any advantage to using the DRAIN
# state in haproxy, or even understand exactly what it does. However,
# it does not remove the stick table entry for the server, so we have
# to issue an additional "clear table be key 127.0.0.1".
#
# Of course, we have to do this for every proxy in my_haproxies.
