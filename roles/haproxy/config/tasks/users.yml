# We may have invoked postgres/createuser in haproxy/config, but setting
# postgres_users on an haproxy instance has no effect. We used to invoke
# createuser conditionally on both haproxy and postgres instances, but
# that became too complicated to sustain.
#
# Instead, we look for any postgres_users settings on haproxy instances
# and reinvoke postgres/createuser on postgres instances with equivalent
# arguments.
