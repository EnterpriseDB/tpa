# There aren't recent-enough etcd packages available in the default
# repositories for Debian, and none at all for RedHat 8. RedHat 7 has
# package available in "extras" which needs to be enabled first.

# The following custom packages (etcd and etcdctl packaged separately)
# are available from an EDB repository for harp.
# Otherwise, the default uses older etcd on Debian and Ubuntu and
# the etcd packages from PGDG on RedHat.
# Patroni uses the default.
