# These tasks bring the managed node's Python installation up to
# Ansible's expectations.

# For Python versions older than 2.7.9, we need to install the
# ssl_match_hostname backport through pip.
#
# XXX We really should be more careful here, but since Debian still
# ships 2.7.3, we can get away with being sloppy for a while longer.
