# We cause the instance to "drop off the network" for a while (from the
# perspective of the rest of the cluster), and then go back to normal.
# We need to retain ssh access to the instance during the partition so
# that we can issue other testing tasks. For now, we cheat by allowing
# all ssh traffic; we can revisit that while testing scenarios where
# inter-node ssh traffic actually matters.
