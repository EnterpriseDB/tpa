# Terminates the proxy-monitor (which must have been started earlier

#
# We expect the proxy-monitor to still be running, but if it's failed on
# its own for some reason, we can find out here. If it's not finished,
# we know it will keep running until we stop it, so we don't need to
# loop over this task "until finished" as we would normally do.
