# Before we start harp2, we must run "harpctl apply" once per unique
# harp_location (because we have set up one etcd per harp_location).
# With BDR, we've already made sure there is only one harp_location
# across the cluster, so the same code will do the right thing.
#
# XXX We should try to detect when the cluster is already initialised,
# and not keep doing this during each deploy.
