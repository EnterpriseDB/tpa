# We must generate the usual (minimal) userlist.txt for pgbouncer, so
# that it can authenticate administrative connections and connect to
# Postgres to run the auth_query.
#
# Since harp_proxy will switch between the various backend servers, they
# had better all have the same pgbouncer password(s) in userlist.txt, so
# we require that bdr_node_group be set on harp-proxy instances (even if
# they are not BDR instances), and use that to find a BDR primary to use
# as the pgbouncer_backend_instance.
#
# Normally, we would restart pgbouncer if userlist.txt changes, but with
# the managed pgbouncer instance, we can't do that safely, so we install
# a restart handler that does nothing.
