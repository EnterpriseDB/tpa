# We set up a new harp-postgres.target that comprises postgres.service
# and harp-manager.service, so that we can start or stop both services
# together.
#
# The harp packages hardcode postgres/postgres, so we must override the
# default unit definitions if we want to run harp services as another
# user or group.
