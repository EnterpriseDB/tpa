- summary: Add missing properties to efm template
  description: |
    Add properties that are present in EFM 4.9 that were not in the
    template already:

    enable.stop.cluster: boolean, default true
    priority.standbys: default ''
    detach.on.agent.failure: boolean, default false
    pid.dir: default ''

    On existing clusters, since this means a change in the EFM
    configuration, TPA will restart EFM services to make sure changes
    are applied.

    EFM agents only process the properties that they know about, so if
    the new properties are written out for an older version of EFM that
    does not use them, they will be ignored.
  # Possible types: notable_change, minor_change, bugfix or breaking_change

  # can define both if you want
  # You must have at least one list item in each *_tickets section that is
  # defined
