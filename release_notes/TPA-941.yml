- summary: Redirect pgbouncer to the new primary in M1 repmgr clusters during switchover
  description: |
      Ensure that pgbouncer instances are redirected to the new primary node after using switchover command
      in a repmgr + pgbouncer cluster that has `repmgr_redirect_pgbouncer` set to true.

      tpaexec switchover command will now ensure that pgbouncer instance connect to the new primary node.

      a new `revert_redirect` variable can also be set as extra-variable after a first switchover is done
      to revert back to the initial primary node.
