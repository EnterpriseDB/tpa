- summary: Update `<clustername>.nodes` when new nodes are added to an existing EFM cluster
  description: |
    When a new EFM node is added to `config.yml`, it is not listed in the 
    `Allowed node host list` on the existing EFM nodes in the cluster.

    The task which executes `efm upgrade-conf` and propagates the changes from
    `/raw/<clustername>.properties` and `/raw/<clustername>.nodes` is now run 
    when EITHER of these files are changed.

    This results in the new EFM node being written to the `<clustername>.nodes` 
    file and `efm cluster-status` including it in the `Allowed node host list`.
