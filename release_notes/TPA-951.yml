- summary: Support for PGD6 architectures
  description: |
    TPA can now configure and deploy clusters using the PGD-X and PGD-S
    architectures based on PGD6

    The PGD-S architecture implements PGD Essential and the PGD-X
    architecture implements PGD Expanded. These architectures have
    sensible default configurations and also accept various configure
    options to customise their behaviour.

    PGD 6 deployments no longer include pgd-proxy; instead, PGD's
    built-in Connection Manager is configured.

    Testing support for the new architectures is added.
