- summary: Fix incorrect detection of cgroup data
  description: |
    Fix two cases of incorrect cgroup detection:
      - on MacOSX, we no longer try to read /proc/mounts
      - on systems where /sys/fs/cgroup is ro but mounts under it are rw, we
        now correctly detect this
  # Possible types: notable_change, minor_change, bugfix or breaking_change
  type: bugfix
  # At least one between jira_tickets or support_tickets must be defined. You
  # can define both if you want
  # You must have at least one list item in each *_tickets section that is
  # defined
  jira_tickets:
  - TPA-760
