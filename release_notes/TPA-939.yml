- summary: Ensure URI for EDB repository setup is accessible
  description: |
    The EDB repos are set up using the Cloudsmith setup script following
    the Cloudsmith documentation: piping the cURL output to bash for execution.

    However, if a user passes a nonexistent `EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN` or repository
    to cURL, the exit code gets silently swallowed and replaced with a 0 because
    bash executes an empty input.

    A request is dispatched to a repository's GPG key endpoint to ensure a `404`
    response is not returned before continuing to download the setup script.

    Tasks related to EDB repository set up are now skipped if the repository has
    already been set up.
