- summary: Document node promotability logic and the `efm-not-promotable` role for EFM
  description: |
    Add a new section to the `efm.md` documentation that explains how TPA
    determines whether a node is eligible for promotion during failover. The
    update clarifies the rules for promotability, including the roles of
    witness nodes, cascading standbys, and nodes explicitly marked with the
    `efm-not-promotable` role. This enhancement should help users understand
    and control failover behavior, reducing the risk of unintended promotions
    in EFM-managed clusters.
