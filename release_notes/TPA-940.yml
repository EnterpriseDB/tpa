- summary: Add a new tasks selectors `create_postgres_system_user` and `create_pgd_proxy_system_user`
  description: |
      Add new task selectors that allow to skip the postgres_user and pgd_proxy_user operating system user.
      This allows clusters to use remote users created by a centralized user management such as
      NIS.

      This can be set in config.yml:

      ```
      cluster_vars:
        excluded_tasks:
          - create_postgres_system_user
          - create_pgd_proxy_system_user
      ```
