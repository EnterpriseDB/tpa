- summary: Correctly configure ignore_slots for patroni clusters with multiple Barman servers
  description: |
    For Patroni clusters TPA will now dynamically generate the ignore_slots
    setting corresponding to Barman nodes in the cluster. This change ensures
    that Patroni will not remove the phyical slots created for each of the
    Barman nodes. This is especially important for the Patroni clusters with
    more than one backup servers; including shared Barman nodes for example.
