- summary: Have `configure` create a user-defined network on docker
  description: |
    The configure command will now automatically add a named network and static IP addresses to config.yml
    when Docker is the selected platform.

    The network name is the same as the cluster name and the address range follows the existing semantics of the
    --network option with the exception that only one subnet is used for the whole cluster rather than one per
    location. If a subnet prefix is not specified by the user, TPA will attempt to select a prefix which results
    in a subnet large enough to fit the whole cluster.

    The key `ip_address` may now be used to specify a static IP for a Docker instance as long as a named network
    is specified in the config.yml.
