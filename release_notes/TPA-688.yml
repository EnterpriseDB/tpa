- summary: Minor postgres upgrades for M1 + patroni clusters
  description: |
    TPA can now upgrade postgres to the latest minor version on an M1
    cluster which uses patroni as the failover manager.

    The upgrade process stops barman on any barman server in the cluster,
    then upgrades the replicas in the cluster. Then it switches to one
    replica as a temporary primary, upgrades postgres on the original
    primary, and switches back to the original primary. Patroni's
    handling of the cluster is paused during the process and resumed
    afterwards. Then barman is restarted and cluster health checks
    are run.
