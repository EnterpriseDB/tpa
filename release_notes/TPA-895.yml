- summary: Check cluster_vars dictionary during validate
  description: |
    Previously, if an invalid dictionary is set as the `cluster_vars`
    dictionary in `config.yml` (such as `cluster_vars` variables referencing
    other `cluster_vars` variables), TPA would swallow any Ansible errors
    by falling back to the default value of an empty dictionary. This
    resulted in every `cluster_vars` variable being undefined, so each was
    set to it's TPA-default value. The resulting cluster would be
    entirely different than what the user specified in their `config.yml`
    file.

    This is fixed by asserting that the `cluster_vars` dictionary is defined
    and non-empty when the configuration file is loaded. Also as a final
    bailout, the `cluster_vars` variable now no longer defaults to an empty
    dictionary. This allows Ansible to throw an error when creating 
    `group_vars` and terminate.
