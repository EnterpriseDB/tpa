- summary: Fixed an issue when backing up from a replica
  description: |
    When taking backups from a replica, barman could fail when taking its
    initial backup by timing out waiting for WAL files. This is fixed by
    waiting for barman to complete its base backup before forcing a WAL
    segment switch.
