- summary: Add support for s390x (aka IBM Z and LinuxONE)
  description: |
     TPA now supports the s390x CPU architecture. Supported s390x
     operating systems are RHEL 8 and 9 and SLES 15. TPA can run
     on these systems and use them as target hosts for cluster
     deployment.

     Because s390x binaries are not available for all PyPI packages, it
     is highly recommended that you install the `tpaexec-deps` package
     from EDB rather than rely on installation from PyPI during setup.

     Similarly, because there is not a PGDG RPM repo for s390x you must
     have access to EDB Repos for TPA to install Postgres and other
     cluster components from packages.
