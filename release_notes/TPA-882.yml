- summary: Make key_id/gpgkey optional in custom repository definitions
  description: |
    The key_id and gpgkey parameters (for apt and yum custom repositories
    definition) are not required by the underlying modules, there are use
    cases where this is not easy to provide ahead of installation. With
    this change, TPA does not make it mandatory to provide those in custom
    repository definitions.
