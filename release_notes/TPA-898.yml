- summary: Improve minor postgres upgrade for M1 + repmgr clusters
  description: |
    Improve minor upgrade of postgres in the context of M1 architecture
    along with repmgr as failover manager.

    Fixed missing upgrade of witness nodes. witness nodes were kept out of
    the process of upgrading, they are now upgraded along with replicas.

    Fixed postgres service restart to be more reliable and always run right
    after the package upgrade on the node is finished.
