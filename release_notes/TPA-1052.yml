- summary: Misconfiguration when 'backup_name' is used
  description: |
      When using the 'backup_name' variable, barman has issues
      when creating a .pgpass file as it uses that same 'backup_name'
      variable for aiming to the backup host.
      This has been fixed by defining the backed up instance's name
      on the ansible workflow on the .pgpass file creation step and
      updating the documentation for proper usage.
