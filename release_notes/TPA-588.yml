- summary: Configure PEM to monitor Barman when both are present in a cluster
  description: |
    When a cluster is configured with PEM enabled (using the --enable-pem
    option) and includes a Barman node, the following actions are now performed
    automatically:

    - `enable_pg_backup_api` is set to `true` in `config.yml`
    - The `pem-agent` role is assigned to the Barman node
    - The Barman endpoint is registered with the local PEM agent

    These changes simplify setup and ensure seamless integration between PEM and Barman.
