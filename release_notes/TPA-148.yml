- summary: `barman` Postgres user should not be a superuser
  description: |
    Certain required privileges are granted to Postgres role, `barman_role`, which is
    then granted to the `barman` Postgres user. This avoids creating the `barman`
    user as a superuser. This role can also be granted to other Postgres users
    by adding it to their `granted_roles` list using `postgres/createuser`.
