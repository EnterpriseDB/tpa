- summary: Fix usability and improve reliability of the TPA Docker image
  description: |
    - Upgraded Base Image to Debian Trixie to meet TPA’s Python 3.12 minimum
      requirement, ensuring compatibility with modern dependencies.
    - Removed `--use-community-ansible` flag as it is no longer supported.
    - Included the `openssh-client` package to prevent `tpaexec` failures due
      to missing `ssh-keygen`, enhancing out-of-the-box functionality.
    - Introduced Build-Time Versioning: Added an `ARG` variable to pass the
      output of `git describe` from the host during build, storing it as
      `/opt/EDB/TPA/VERSION` for improved version tracking.
    - Revised `docker/README.md` and `docs/src/INSTALL-docker.md` to reflect
      the latest setup instructions and best practices.

    These changes enhance the TPA Docker image’s compatibility, stability, and
    ease of use.
