- summary: Ensure we flush handlers soon after finishing postgres configuration
  description: |
    This problem manifested itself when a new node was added to a repmgr
    or efm cluster, TPA would fail to reload/restart postgres on
    existing nodes to re-read configuration changes and the new node
    would therefore fail to connect to the cluster.
