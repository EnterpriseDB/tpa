- summary: Add three release.vip.* properties for EFM 5.1 and above
  description: |
    Starting with EFM 5.1, there will be three new properties that control
    the timing of when the VIP is released by the primary agent (if
    a VIP is used). This allows the user to avoid having the VIP released
    at the same time new database connections are being made, which can
    lead to connection failures and a failure of switchover in some environments.
    The new properties are:
    release.vip.background
    release.vip.pre.wait
    release.vip.post.wait
  # Possible types: notable_change, minor_change, bugfix or breaking_change
  type: minor_change
  # At least one between jira_tickets or support_tickets must be defined. You
  # can define both if you want
  # You must have at least one list item in each *_tickets section that is
  # defined
  jira_tickets:
  - TPA-1163
