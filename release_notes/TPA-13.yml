- summary: Remove support for Raid volume creation on AWS
  description: |
    TPA no longer supports RAID creation on AWS. All EBS volumes are automatically
    replicated across different servers which might be seen as redundant if during
    or before boot, a RAID device is provisioned. If anyone despite this level of
    default availability provided by AWS still requires a form of software RAID,
    the device must be created manually and configured to be used by TPA afterwards.
