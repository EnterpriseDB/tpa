- summary: Support STIG/CIS compliance
  description: |
    TPA now supports command-line options to create a cluster configured
    to conform to many of the requirements of the STIG and CIS security
    standards.

    These options cause TPA to set many postgresql.conf settings as
    defined in the relevant standards, to install required extensions,
    to configure other aspects of system behaviour such as filesystem
    permissions and user connection limits, and to check for other
    requirements such as FIPS crypto standards which TPA can't directly
    impose.

    The clusters thus generated are not certified by TPA to conform to
    the standards, but much of the groundwork of creating a conforming
    cluster is now automated.
