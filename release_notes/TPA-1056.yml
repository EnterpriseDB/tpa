- summary: Suppress PGDG repos when using EDB repos on SLES
  description: |
    When running `tpaexec configure` for a SLES system, use either EDB
    repositories or PGDG repositories, not both, matching the behaviour
    of other operating systems. This ensures that packages such as barman,
    which are available in both places, are consistently sourced from the
    same repository as other packages.
