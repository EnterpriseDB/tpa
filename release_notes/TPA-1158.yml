- summary: Exclude BDR5 alter_node_option task for replicas
  description: |
    In a `BDR5` cluster with a BDR node that is also a physical replica, 
    the upgrade process will fail during the `alter_node_option` task because 
    a BDR node is expected to have `RAFT` enabled, but the physical replica 
    BDR node does not. Skipping this task on any node with the replica role
    avoids this issue and allows upgrade to complete successfuly.
