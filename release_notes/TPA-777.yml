- summary: Added experimental support for using an existing Barman node as backup node in new cluster
  description: |
    When using an existing Barman node as a backup node in a new cluster, users
    can set `barman_shared: true` in the Barman instance's vars with the platform
    set to `bare` and other information supplied as usual for bare instances.

    This change allows TPA to skip some configuration steps that would
    otherwise fail due to usermod issues, as the Barman user already has
    running processes from previous deployments.

    The shared Barman instance is treated as a bare instance, so the required
    access, including the Barman user's access to the target PostgreSQL
    instances, must be already in place. Copying the Barman user's keys from
    the original cluster to the new cluster can be used to achieve this, 
    see the Barman section of the TPA documentation for detailed information.
