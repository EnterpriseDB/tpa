- summary: Add `postgis` to list of recognized extensions
  description: |
    The PostGIS package will automatically be added when a user specifies 
    `postgis` as an entry in either `postgres_extensions` or the list of
    extensions named under `postgres_databases`.

    Also enables the CRB (Code Ready Builder) repository for RHEL-compatible
    distributions so PostGIS dependencies can be installed.
