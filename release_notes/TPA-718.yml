- summary: Allow customer's to use their own SSL certificates on the PEM server
  description: |
    Users can include the names of the certificate and key pair for use on the PEM server in `config.yml`
    under the cluster_vars or pem-server instance vars `pem_server_ssl_certificate` and `pem_server_ssl_key`.
    TPA will copy them from the `ssl/pemserver` directory of the cluster directory to the PEM server and 
    configure Apache/httpd accordingly.
