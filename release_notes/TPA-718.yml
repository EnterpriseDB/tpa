- summary: Allow customer's to use their own SSL certificates on the PEM server
  description: |
    Users can include the names of the certificate and key pair for use on the PEM server in `config.yml`
    under the cluster_vars or pem-server instance vars `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_key`.
    TPA will copy them from the cluster directory to the PEM server, skip generating a self-signed TLS 
    key and certificate pair and configure Apache/httpd accordingly.
