- summary: Treat PEM_DB_PORT as a string for PEM 10.1 and above
  description: |
    PEM 10.1 adds support for multi-host connection strings from the web
    application to the backend servers. To support this change, the PEM_DB_PORT
    parameter in PEM's `config_setup.py` file is now a string rather than an
    integer. While TPA does not yet support deploying HA PEM configurations,
    TPA will now correctly set this parameter as a string when the PEM version
    is 10.1 or greater.
