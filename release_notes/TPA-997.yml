- summary: Add `pgaudit` package names for `edbpge`
  description: |
    Previously, adding `pgaudit` to the list of Postgres extensions with 
    the `edbpge` Postgres flavour would fail because the dictionary for
    handling recognized extensions was missing an entry for `edbpge` and
    it's corresponding package names. This entry is added, and additional
    logic is incorporated to handle naming change for `pgaudit` packages
    from version 16 onwards.
