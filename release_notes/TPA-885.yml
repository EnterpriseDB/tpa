- summary: Deploys fail for distributions which have no additional repository setup commands for extensions
  description: |
    When `postgis` is added to `extra_postgres_extensions` or the `extensions` 
    list of a database in `postgres_databases`, deploys fail for Debian,
    SLES and Ubuntu because their list of `repository_setup_commands` is
    empty (only RHEL has an additional command to run`crb enable`).

    This empty list of commands looped over and passed to the `command` module,
    which fails with `no command given`, resulting in deployment failure.

    As a result, the `Automatically run additional repository setup commands 
    for recognized extensions` task is now skipped if the distribution has
    no additional commands to run.
