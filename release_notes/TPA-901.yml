- summary: Use SLES15SP6 as the standard SLES for nodes
  description: |
    When SLES is requested at configure-time, TPA will now install SLES15SP6.

    The docker and EC2 images are now SP6, and the systemd-sysvcompat package
    is installed on SLES, so that local boot-time scripts continue to work.
