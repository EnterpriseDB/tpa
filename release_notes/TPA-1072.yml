- summary: Enable standard repo when beacon agent is desirable
  description: |
    TPA can deploy the beacon agent to monitor the health of a system, however,
    it needs access to a valid EDB repository. This change ensures that the standard
    repository is enabled when the beacon agent is to be deployed.
