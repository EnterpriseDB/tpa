- summary: Make `password_encryption` algorithm for `efm` Postgres user configurable.
  description: |
    Expose a configurable `efm_user_password_encryption` variable which should
    be set to either `'md5'` or `'scram-sha-256'` depending on user requirements.
    This controls the `auth-method` for the `efm` Postgres user in `pg_hba.conf` 
    and the algorithm used for generating it's encrypted password.

    In clusters deployed with `compliance` configured to `stig`, the 'efm' Postgres
    user's `auth-method` in `pg_hba.conf` will be set to `scram-sha-256` since 
    FIPS-enabled operating systems do not allow `md5` to be used.
