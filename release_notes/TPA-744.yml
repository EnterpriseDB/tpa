- summary: Set appropriate PEM agent parameters monitored servers
  description: |
    TPA broadly sets PEM agent parameters on all instances that are only 
    appropriate for the pemserver instance. This is fixed by conditionally
    setting parameters in `agent.cfg.j2` based on whether or not the node 
    is a pem-server.
