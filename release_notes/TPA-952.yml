    In TPA's default output plugin, tasks which return "ok" but with
    no changes are now separated from ones that have reported changes,
    which are now highlighted in yellow.
  # Possible types: notable_change, minor_change, bugfix or breaking_change

  # can define both if you want

  # defined
