- summary: Change default output to TPA's own format
  description: |
    Ansible's default output plugin shows a lot of information, much of
    which is useful when debugging but obscures the flow of information if
    you just want to see what TPA is doing. TPA now has its own output
    plugin, which shows one line of information per task, omitting tasks
    for which even one line would be uninformative. The lines are indented
    to enable TPA's control flow to be visible, and include colour-coded
    counts of successful, skipped, and ignored hosts.

    The fuller output can be turned on by setting TPA_USE_DEFAULT_OUTPUT=true
    in your environment, or by adding the -v switch to the command line.
