- summary: Skip raft checks for BDR nodes with replica role
  description: |
    In this particular scenario, a `BDR`/`PGD` architecture incorporates
    `repmgr` to handle physical replication of a `subscriber-only` BDR node
    to another BDR node which acts as a backup. Due to previous 
    limitations, it was not possible to use two `subscriber-only` nodes.

    The PGD upgrade process was failing because the physical replica BDR
    node does not have RAFT enabled. As a fix, certain BDR-specific tasks
    in the upgrade process now skip any node that has a `replica` role,
    allowing for a successful upgrade.
