- summary: Skip raft checks for BDR nodes with replica role
  description: |
    Physical replication of a `subscriber-only` node can be achieved in a `PGD`
    cluster by installing `repmgr` as a failover-manager and designating the
    `subscriber-only` node as the `primary` and listing another BDR data node 
    as the `backup`; this backup node is given the `replica` role.

    This configuration would result in the PGD upgrade process failing, since
    TPA expects BDR data nodes to have RAFT enabled, but the physical replica
    BDR data node (with both `replica` and `bdr` roles) by design does not.

    As a fix, certain BDR-specific tasks in the upgrade process now skip any node that 
    has a `replica` role, allowing for a successful upgrade.
