  description: |
    When a user specifies `edb_stat_monitor` as an entry in either
    `postgres_extensions` or the list of extensions named under 
    `postgres_databases`, TPA will handle installing the correct
    package, creating the extension and including it in the 
    `shared_preload_libraries`.
