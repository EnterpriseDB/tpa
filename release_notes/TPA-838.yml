  description: |
    TPA is now able to generate a PGD Lightweight architecture comprised of
    three nodes in two locations (2 nodes in Primary and one in Disaster
    Recovery) designed to ease migrations from physical replication.

    Users can now run `tpaexec configure lw -a Lightweight --postgresql 15`.
