- summary: Document `include_vars` behavior for templated variables
  description: |
    Since the `include_vars` module immediately parses and evaluates
    expressions, nested variables do not exist at the point they are
    loaded from `config.yml` and thus are undefined when evaluated in
    templated expressions. This is now documented with an example so it
    is clearer for users.
  # Possible types: notable_change, minor_change, bugfix or breaking_change
  type: minor_change
  # At least one between jira_tickets or support_tickets must be defined. You
  # can define both if you want
  # You must have at least one list item in each *_tickets section that is
  # defined
  jira_tickets:
  - TPA-895
  - TPA-1033
