    `primary_slot_name` added for EFM compatibility interferes with `bdr_init_physical`
  description: |
    A `primary_slot_name` is configured on the primary node to 
    ensure the old primary uses a physical slot for replication 
    during an EFM switchover. However, 'bdr_init_physical' attempts 
    to use it for node initialisation and hangs indefinitely since 
    the slot does not exist in a PGD installation.

    This `primary_slot_name` is now conditionally set explicitly when the 
    `failover_manager` is EFM or Patroni to avoid setting it unnecessarily.
