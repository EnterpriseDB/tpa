- summary: Extended support for configuring PGD-S clusters
  description: |
    TPA now supports a full set of dedicated options for configuring a
    PGD-S cluster.

    The --layout option can be set to "standard" for a one-location or
    "near-far" for a two-location layout.

    The --add-subscriber-only-nodes option adds up to 10 subscriber-only
    nodes.

    The --read-write-port, --read-only-port, --http-port, and --use-https
    options control Connection Manager's ports and http API.
