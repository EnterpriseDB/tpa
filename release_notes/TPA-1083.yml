- summary: Introduce pgd-proxy-config hook
  description: |
    Introduce a hook to run tasks from pgd-proxy-config.yml at the end of PGD
    Proxy config, after core dirs/files are set but before the PGD Proxy
    service starts. Developers of the hook must ensure task idempotency. This
    hook will come in handy for various post-configuration tasks e.g. making
    adjustments to PGD Proxy configuration not supported by TPA interface and
    other relevant cluster-specific settings.
