- summary: Ignore proxy settings when accessing the Patroni API
  description: |
    The Ansible default is to use a proxy, if defined. This does not
    work in the (rather common) case of an airgapped environment that
    needs a proxy to download packages from the internet, because the
    proxy also intercepts (and disrupts) calls to the Patroni API.
