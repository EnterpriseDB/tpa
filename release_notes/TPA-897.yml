- summary: Set `bdr_client_dsn_attributes` as the default for `pgd_proxy_dsn_attributes` and `pgd_cli_dsn_attributes`
  description: |
    Because pgd-proxy and pgd-cli are written in Go and use a Go driver,
    they do not support the full set of parameter keywords supported by
    libpq.

    In the case a cluster has installed pgd-proxy and/or pgd-cli and has
    configured `bdr_client_dsn_attributes` with parameters that the Go
    driver does *not* support, two new configuration variables must be
    included: `pgd_proxy_dsn_attributes` and `pgd_cli_dsn_attributes`, 
    containing only additional DSN parameters that the Go driver
    supports.

    Conversely, if pgd-proxy and pgd-cli are installed and
    `bdr_client_dsn_attributes` does not include any Go-incompatible
    parameters, the connection strings for these tools will be configured
    with the attributes in `bdr_client_dsn_attributes`.

    This amends unexpected behavior where the `pgd_proxy_dsn_attributes`
    and `pgd_cli_dsn_attributes` were defaulting to empty strings when
    not defined, even though the user was expecting the parameters in 
    `bdr_client_dsn_attributes` to be used.
