- summary: Fix support for update_host variable on PDG-Always-ON
  description: |
    TPA is now able to honor update_hosts variable for minor postgres and minor PGD5 upgrade
    scenario when using PGD-Always-ON architecture.

    By specifying update_hosts variable in the tpaexec upgrade command, TPA will now upgrade
    this subset of nodes during postgres and PGD minor upgrade and let the remaining nodes
    on the currently installed versions.

    This should allow for more controlled upgrade that can be split into multiple runs
    in order to better control and test the cluster along the upgrade process.

    It is recommended to use this feature while still keeping best practices in mind
    such as always updating write leaders last and testing in a dev/staging environment first.
