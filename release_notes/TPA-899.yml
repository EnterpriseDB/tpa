- summary: Copy EFM config files if they are removed, even if no configuration changes
  description: |
    If either the `efm.nodes` or `efm.properties` configuration files
    do not exist in the top-level EFM directory, the `efm upgrade-conf` 
    command copies them from the `/raw` directory, even if there have
    been no configuration changes. 
    
    This amends previous behavior that required a configuration change 
    before the `upgrade-conf` command would run and copy files.
