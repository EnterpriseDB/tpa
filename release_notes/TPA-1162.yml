- summary: Document
  description: |
    Previously, the TPA docs mentioned that TPA generates default certs but not their names or paths.
    This change adds that information and also explains how to replace these files with your own.
    We now document the previously undocumented `ssl_*` cluster vars for this purpose.
    The new content is placed in `postgresql.conf.md` and linked from the original location `postgres_user.md`.
