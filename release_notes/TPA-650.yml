- summary: Allow cert authentication on pgbouncer
  description: |
    pgbouncer can now use cert authentication when connecting to its
    postgres backend. This is particularly useful with FIPS; it's
    required because the authentication algorithm is also changed, from
    md5 to scram-sha-256. The variable
    `pgbouncer_use_cert_authentication` must be defined to true in
    cluster_vars, should someone decide to enable this mode. When this
    mode is enabled, TPA will create a CA and two more certificates
    replacing the self-signed certificate created by default in all
    clusters.

    Change requires a postgres restart.
