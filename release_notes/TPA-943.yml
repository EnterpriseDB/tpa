- summary: Remove support for old repositories
  description: |
    Now that the old 2q repositories and original EDB repositories are no
    longer available, TPA will no longer try to use them or check for
    configuration related to them.

    All packages that were formerly available in those repositories are now
    available in the EDB 2.0 repositories.
  # Possible types: notable_change, minor_change, bugfix or breaking_change
  type: notable_change
  # At least one between jira_tickets or support_tickets must be defined. You
  # can define both if you want
  # You must have at least one list item in each *_tickets section that is
  # defined
  jira_tickets:
  - TPA-544
  - TPA-943
