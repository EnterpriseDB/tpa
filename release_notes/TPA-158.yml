- summary: Ensure pgpass_users correctly added to .pgpass file
  description: |
    Previously, any user in the `postgres_users` list specified with
    `generate_password: true` AND included in the `pgpass_users` list
    would NOT be added to the `~postgres/.pgpass` file on the initial
    deploy because the user's password did not yet exist when the
    pgpass task was executed, thus the user was skipped.

    This is fixed by invoking the pgpass task once more after all the
    Postgres users have been created.

    Furthermore, the `repmgr` user was previously part of the `default_pgpass_users`
    list unless overridden by the `pgpass_users` list in `config.yml`. Now it is only
    added to the  ~postgres/pgpass file as part of the `role/repmgr` tasks, when 
    `repmgr` is specified as the `failover_manager`

    The `postgres_user` (`postgres` or `enterprisedb` by default) is still part
    of the `default_pgpass_users` list. If this is overridden by a `pgpass_users` list 
    in `config.yml` that does NOT include `postgres_user`, a PEM-enabled cluster will
    fail to register agents as it needs the encrypted `postgres_user` password.
    This is fixed by adding the `postgres_user` to the `~postgres/.pgpass` file
    as part of the PEM agent tasks.
