- summary: Minor postgres upgrades for M1 + EFM clusters
  description: |
    TPA can now upgrade postgres to the latest minor version on an M1 cluster
    which uses EFM as the failover manager.

    The upgrade process stops barman on any barman server in the cluster,
    then upgrades the replicas in the clusters.  Then it switches to one
    replica as a temporary primary, upgrades postgres on the original
    primary, and switches back to the original primary. The EFM agent
    is started and stopped on the different servers at the correct
    times. Then barman is restarted and cluster health checks are run.
