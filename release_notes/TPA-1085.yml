- summary: Do not attempt to enable routing for subscriber-only groups
  description: |
      Previously, TPA would mistakenly try to enable routing for subscriber-only groups
      during PGD6 deployments. This property is not editable anymore as it forms core part of the
      definition of subscriber-only groups in PGD6.
