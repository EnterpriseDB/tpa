- summary: Add `replication` user to .pgpass on primary node
  description: |
    The `replication_user` entry is required the `.pgpass` file for both
    `replica` and `primary` nodes managed by either `efm` or `patroni` as
    the `failover_manager`. Previously, it was only added to the .pgass file
    for `replica` nodes, resulting in connection issues to the primary
    node after a switchover.
