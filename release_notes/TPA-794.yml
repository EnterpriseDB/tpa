- summary: Download correct `bash-completion` package version
  description: |
    If the `pgdcli_package_version` is specified in `config.yml`, the 
    `bash-completion` package is incorrectly named because the 
    `packages_for` filter erroneously appends the `pgdcli_package_version` 
    to the  package name. This results in an attempt to download a nonexistant
    package.

    The `bash-completion` package is now appended to the list after the
    `packages_for` filter, since it's version is independent from the 
    `pgdcli_package_version`.
