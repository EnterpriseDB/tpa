- summary: Use bdr_package_version as default pgd proxy version
  description: |
    pgd_proxy_package_version and pgdcli_package_version may be explicitly
    defined in config.yml; if they are not explicitly defined, they now
    default to the value of bdr_package_version, if it is set. If none of
    them is set, the latest available versions of packages are installed.

    Setting these package versions to different values is not supported and
    is only useful for testing.
