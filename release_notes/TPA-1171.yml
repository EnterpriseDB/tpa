- summary: Skip postgres/pgpass task on PEM-agent Barman nodes
  description: |
    The `postgres/pgpass` task runs on pem-agent nodes in order to add the
    `postgres_user` to the `.pgpass` file in this user's home directory. 
    However, this task fails on barman nodes that are also pem-agents, since 
    the directory does not exist. 
    This task is now excluded for barman nodes.
