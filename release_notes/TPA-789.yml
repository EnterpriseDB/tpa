- summary: Remove EFM dependency for resolving upstream_primary
  description: |
    Previously, EFM was queried for the current primary on a deploy after 
    a switchover. If EFM is not running, this will fail. 
    Now the cluster_facts collected through Postgres are used to determine 
    the current primary after a switchover, removing the dependency on EFM.
