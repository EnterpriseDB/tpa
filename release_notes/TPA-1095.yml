    Fixed an issue whereby PEM deployment would fail with PEM 10.1.1
  description: |
    The TPA task `Register PEM backend database server for monitoring
    and configuration` explicitly calls the `pem.setup` SQL function.
    This is not considered part of the public API of PEM and the
    signature changed between 10.1.0 and 10.1.1 causing TPA\s call to
    this function to fail.

    This fix addresses the issue by adjusting the function call
    according to the installed PEM server version. To accommodate this
    change we have introduced a new `pem/server/facts` Ansible role that
    is responsible for collecting facts about the installed PEM version.
    This also means that TPA will no longer attempt to run
    `postgresexpert.sql` on PEM 10, where Postgres Expert is no longer
    present.
