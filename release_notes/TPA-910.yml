- summary: Raise ArchitectureError for --network flag during configure
  description: |
    By default, the Python standard library `ipaddress` package enforces
    'strict' interpretation of the CIDR, whereby the IP used should be
    the network address of the range.

    Previously, any IP passed to the `--network` flag that contained host
    bits would dump a stacktrace due to the raised ValueError. 
    
    That exception is now caught and an ArchitectureError is raised to
    display a clear message to the user about the `--network` parameter.
