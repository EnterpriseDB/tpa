- summary: Add new option when using etcd with HARP
  description: |
    Add new optional var `harp_local_etcd_only` available when using etcd
    with HARP. This option tells HARP manager to connect to local etcd node.
    This recommendation follows the best practices learnt by doing the same
    when `bdr` as consensus procotol is being used.

    The default mode of adding multiple endpoints can lead to performance issues
    in some cases. This option is added to give more control to the user.
