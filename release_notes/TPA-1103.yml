- summary: Do not use `pgdproxy` user in DSN on BDR6 nodes
  description: |
    Since PGD version 6 has a built-in Connection Manager which replaces
    PGD Proxy, the `pgdproxy` Postgres user should not be used in any DSNs.
    A new variable `bdr_connection_manager_route_dsn` is introduced for
    defining connection strings to Connection Manager. User's can 
    additionally define `bdr_connection_manager_dsn_attributes` in their
    `config.yml` to specify additional connection paramters in the DSN.
