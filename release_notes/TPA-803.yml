- summary: Support PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Extended, and EDB Postgres Advanced Server 17
  description: |
    Clusters can be configured to use PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Extended and 
    EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 17.

    Barman no longer needs to install the postgres server package to get 
    the `pg_receivewal` binary when using EDB Postgres Advanced Server 17 or 
    EDB Postgres Extended 17 since the binary has been added to the client 
    package for these versions.
    
    Raise an architecture error when a cluster is configured with `repmgr` 
    as the failover_manager as it is not available for Postgres 17.
    
    Updated documentation to reflect supported versions.
