- summary: Create `harp_dcs_user` when using multiple failover managers
  description: |
    There's a support case regarding a custom BDR cluster. This one includes a
    subscriber-only node that is also a primary node for a second failover
    manager: repmgr. The `harp_dcs_user` is required to be present as well
    before `bdr join` can be run, so the user needs to be created at the
    end of repmgr tasks.
