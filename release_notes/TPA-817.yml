- summary: Only add nodes with `efm` role to cluster `efm.nodes` file
  description: |
    A support ticket questioned why the `pemserver` and `barman` nodes are
    added to the `Allowed node host list` in EFM when they are not 
    relevant to EFM functions. Refactored the task that writes the `efm.node`
    configuration to only include those nodes that have `efm` in their list 
    of roles.
