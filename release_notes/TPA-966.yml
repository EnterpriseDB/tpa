- summary: Improve behaviour of postgres_package_version
  description: |
    Setting postgres_package_version will now cause TPA to install the
    selected version of various postgres-related components on Debian or
    Ubuntu systems installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres
    Extended Server. This avoids dependency resolution problems when newer
    package versions are visible in repositories.
