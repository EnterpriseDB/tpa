- summary: Fix shared_preload_libraries computing during deploy
  description: |
      Fix a limitation from ansible's handling of list ordering that would
      trigger unneeded and uncontrolled rewritting of the
      shared_preload_libraries and subsequently require a postgres service
      restart, even on second deployment scenarios with no changes to the
      configuration.
