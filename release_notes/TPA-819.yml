- summary: Fix tpaexec test for pgd-proxy config verification
  description: |
    Fixed a bug whereby the test that ensures the current pgd-proxy configuration
    matches the expected configuration would fail for version < 5.5.0. This fix
    ensures that TPA won't try to query configuration keys added in version 5.5.0.
