- summary: Fix check mode when not using harp
  description: |
      Fix the check mode for both deploy and upgrade when running a cluster
      without harp.
      the `Read current configuration file if exists` task needs to run in check mode
      to ensure we have the information available to correctly skip the following harp
      check task.
      shell module is by default skipped during check mode, we now let ansible know
      that this task has to be run.

  # defined
