- summary: Set up EDB repositories via setup script for RedHat and Debian
  description: |
    The repository manager provides a shell script that sets up the 
    desired EDB repositories.
    
    This simplifies EDB repository setup on TPA nodes into a single task.

    Currently it is only done for `dnf`/'yum' and `apt` package managers; the
    setup script was encountering an issue with `zypper` when the setup script
    is run on subsequent deploys.

    Due to this, SLES sets up EDB repositories without using the script.
