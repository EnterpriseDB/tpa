- summary: Added support for upgrading EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) v5 clusters to v6
  description: |
    TPA now provides a workflow for upgrading an existing PGD-Always-ON cluster to a PGD-X cluster.
    Due to the significant differences between these architectures,
    this is a multi-step process whereby you must first upgrade to PGD 5.9, then enable connection manager,
    then finally upgrade to PGD 6.
    This process will be further automated in a future TPA release.
    Please refer to the TPA docs for full details.
