- summary: Use EDB repository setup script on SUSE
  description: |
    Previously, we did not use the EDB repository setup script
    on SUSE because it did not work on repeat deploys. Zypper would
    raise because the repositories that the script attempts to install
    already exist, and require unique names.

    Now that the repository setup script task is skipped if the
    repositories are already installed, this issue is not encountered.
