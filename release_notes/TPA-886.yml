- summary: Fix documentation for `efm_conf_settings`
  description: |
    Previously, documentation stated
    ```
    You can use efm_conf_settings to set any parameters, whether recognised by TPA or not. 
    
    Where needed, you need to quote the value exactly as it would appear in efm.properties
    ```

    However, the `efm.properties.j2` template uses the values from `efm_conf_settings` as an Ansible dictionary, 
    so the entries must be written in `key: value` form.

    ```yaml
    cluster_vars:
      efm_conf_settings:
        notification.level: WARNING
        ping.server.ip: <well known address in the network>
    ```
  # Possible types: notable_change, minor_change, bugfix or breaking_change
  type: minor_change
  # At least one between jira_tickets or support_tickets must be defined. You
  # can define both if you want
  # You must have at least one list item in each *_tickets section that is
  # defined
  jira_tickets:
  - TPA-886
