- summary: Support package version specifiers for all cluster comppnents
  description: |
    All components must be able to specify the package version in `config.yml` in
    order for `tpaexec upgrade` to support minor version upgrades so that the 
    desired version is known.

    The following software packages accept an `--xxx-package-version` option to the
    `tpaexec configure` command, which populates `xxx_package_version` in the generated
    `config.yml`
