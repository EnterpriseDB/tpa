- summary: Running deploy after a switchover fails for nodes with `efm-witness` role
  description: |
    The `upstream-primary` for EFM nodes is determined using the facts
    gathered from Postgres. This fails for nodes with `efm-witness` roles 
    since they do not have Postgres. The task to determine upstream-primary 
    is now run only on nodes with `primary` or `replica` roles
