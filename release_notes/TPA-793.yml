- summary: Add `pem-agent` role on barman nodes at most once for M1 architecture
  description: |
    If `--enable-pem` and `--enable-pg-backup-api` are passed to `tpaexec configure`,
    `pem-agent` is added twice to the `barman` node if it is also a `witness`. 
    Fixed by by consolidating both `if` statements together to only evaluate 
    the conditions once.
