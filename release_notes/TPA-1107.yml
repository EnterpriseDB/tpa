- summary: Remove TPA post-deploy check for pgbouncer_auth_function in pg_catalog.
  description: |
      TPA recently relocated the pgbouncer_auth_function used to authenticate users when pgbouncer is in 
      use. This was done in an effort to better follow the best practices and avoid issues during upgrade
      where pg_catalog function would not be part of the dump of the database.
      TPA introduced a post deploy check to help user still relying on the auth function defined in
      pg_catalog to identify the problem and make sure that they are able to fix it before removing the
      function from their systems.
      This check was used as a transition mechanism and is now being removed.
