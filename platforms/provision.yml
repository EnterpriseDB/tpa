  ## Configuration
  #
  # We will provision the cluster described by clustername/config.yml
  # (run «provision … -e config=x.yml» to use a different filename).
  #
  # The configuration must define an array of instances along with
  # other supporting top-level settings described elsewhere.
  #
  #   cluster_name: Example
  #
  #   instance_defaults:
  #     platform: bare
  #
  #   instances:
  #     - node: 1
  #       Name: foo
  #       …
  #
  #     - node: 2
  #       Name: bar
  #       platform: aws
  #       …
  #
  # Each instance may declare the platform it is to be provisioned on.
  # If the instance definition does not specify a platform, we use the
  # default value given at the top level (or 'aws' if unspecified).
  #
  # First, we load the configuration file and validate it (which has
  # both platform-independent and platform-specific parts).

  - name: Exit if there are no changes to config.yml since the last provision
    set_fact:
      no_recent_config_changes: true

  ## Validation
  #
  # Now we check that the configuration is valid. We perform generic
  # tests first, followed by platform-specific ones.
  #
  # For convenience, we separate instances[] into aws_instances[],
  # bare_instances[], and so on, and each platform can operate on its
  # set of instances without worrying about filtering out entries for
  # other platforms. We also set some other derived facts here.

  - import_tasks: validate.yml
    tags: always

  ## Provisioning
  #
  # Now we perform platform-independent provisioning tasks, then give
  # each platform handler a chance to do whatever it wants with its
  # subset of the defined instances.
  #
  # If there are any shared instances, they are processed last, so that
  # the instance they are "hosted_by" has already been provisioned.

    loop_control:
      loop_var: platform

  ## Writing the inventory
  #
  # Each platform has had a chance to operate on its xxx_instances[],
  # and add the results to instance_vars[], which forms the basis for
  # the combined inventory that we write out at the end.

      ("%s/%s/inventory/write.yml"|format(playbook_dir, platform)) is file

      ansible_port: "{{ cluster_ssh_port|default(22) }}"

  ## Post-inventory hooks
  #
  # We can generalise this to work per-platform if platforms ever need it.
