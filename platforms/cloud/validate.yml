# Validation rules and fact setting for platforms that have common cloud properties

# If we need to create any security groups ourselves, they should have
# the following rules.

- name: Set default security group rules for the cluster
  set_fact:
    ssh_port: "{{ cluster_ssh_port|default(22)|int }}"
    cluster_rules: "{{ cluster_rules|default(default_cluster_rules) }}"
  vars:
    default_cluster_rules:
      - {proto: tcp, from_port: 22, to_port: 22, cidr_ip: 0.0.0.0/0}
      - {proto: udp, from_port: 1194, to_port: 1194, cidr_ip: 0.0.0.0/0}

- name: Add custom ssh port to security group
  set_fact:
    cluster_rules: "{{
        cluster_rules|union([
          dict(proto='tcp', from_port=ssh_port, to_port=ssh_port, cidr_ip='0.0.0.0/0')
        ])
      }}"
  when:
    ssh_port|int != 22

# The use of `instances` below is potentially not specific enough. For
# example, in a mixed cluster with AWS and Azure and bare instances, the
# PEM server may be on a bare instance, and we don't need to expose port
# 443 on the cloud instances at all. But it seems quite likely that you
# would need to specify explicit rules in such complex scenarios, so
# this suffices as a default for now.
