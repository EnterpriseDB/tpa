Bare-metal servers
------------------

Set «platform: bare» in config.yml

This platform is meant to support any server that is accessible via SSH,
including bare-metal servers as well as already-provisioned servers on
any cloud platform (including AWS).

The username and IP address(es) of the server must be defined
explicitly. The user is required to be able to sudo to root.
