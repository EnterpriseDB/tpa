# We register ssh_key_file.pub as ec2_key_name in each region, and set
# ec2_instance_key to the name of the registered key.
#
# We cache ec2_instance_key so that provision.yml can avoid invoking us
# if the key is already registered. As long as vars.json disappears when
# the key does, that works fine. (To do any better, we would also need to
# cache the key_material and compare it to the key on disk. That doesn't
# seem worth the effort, because the key shouldn't change.)
