# Given a region and a VPC specification (which may take various forms),
# we return a vpc-id. If the desired VPC does not already exist, we try
# to create it if a Name and cidr are specified.
#
# The natural way to express this would be to call ec2_vpc_net with the
# given name and cidr, and also call ec2_tag if it "changed". Alas, due
# to https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core/issues/3613, the
# ec2_vpc_net module always sets "changed".
#
# We also don't want to use ec2_vpc, because if the VPC exists already,
# we don't want to force any changes to its igw or routing tables or
# subnets to make them be the way we would have created them. So we
# search for the VPC first and create it if nothing matches.
