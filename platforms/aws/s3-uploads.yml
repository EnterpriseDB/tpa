# We upload anything specified in s3_uploads to cluster_bucket in S3.
# For example,
#
#   s3_uploads:
#   - foo         # filenames relative to cluster_dir
#   - id_*        # wildcards relative to cluster_dir
#   - /etc/hosts  # absolute paths (including wildcards)
#
# It is not currently an error for one of the items in the list to not
# exist; the other items that are found will be uploaded.
