      TPAexec needs access to an S3 bucket to provision this cluster.

      TPAexec can create a bucket named {{ cluster_bucket }} for you now.

      To use an existing bucket, set `cluster_bucket: name-of-bucket` in config.yml
      (or configure your cluster with `--cluster-bucket name-of-bucket`). If you want
      to create a new bucket yourself, you can do so with a command like:

          aws s3 mb s3://name-of-bucket --region {{ aws_regions[0] }}

      TPAexec will never remove any S3 buckets when you deprovision the cluster. To remove
      the bucket yourself, run: `aws s3 rb s3://name-of-bucket --force`

      To create an S3 bucket named {{ cluster_bucket }} now, type "yes"
