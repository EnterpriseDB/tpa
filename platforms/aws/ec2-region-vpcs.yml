# At this point, ec2_vpc is either {Name: …, cidr: …} (one specification
# across regions) or {r1: {Name: …, cidr: …, filters: …}, r2: …}

#
# XXX We assume that ec2_vpc[r] is the correct specification for region
# r, but do not check that ec2_vpc either has no region keys, or all of
# the ones in the list of regions. We originally accepted ec2_vpc with
# or without regions to maintain backwards compatibility, but I think
# the dual scheme is too clever for its own good.
#
# We invoke vpc.yml with a region and the VPC specification for that
# region, and expect it to define ec2_region_vpcs[region].
