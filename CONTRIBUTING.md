Guidelines for contributors
===========================

## Commit messages

Please use the conventional commit message format: a single-line summary
of the change, optionally followed by a blank line and then any number
of lines of additional free-form commentary.

### Summary line

Initial capital, preferably <60 characters, no trailing period.

Ideally written in imperative mood (e.g., "Document …", "Simplify …",
"Remove …", "Change …", "Fix …").

A leading tag may sometimes be helpful to clearly communicate the scope
of a particular change, e.g., "zabbix: Fix .pgpass generation" or
"Testing: Increase default failure timeouts". Use your judgement.
