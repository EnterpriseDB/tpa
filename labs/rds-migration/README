These scripts demonstrate the steps required to replicate data out of
RDS using Londiste and Bucardo.

Currently Londiste using the plonly pgq triggers has a horribly high overhead.
If we replace the generic logutrigga triggers with a cut down bespoke
trigger function for each table the overhead is reduced a lot, but it's
still a lot more than Bucardo is out of the box.
