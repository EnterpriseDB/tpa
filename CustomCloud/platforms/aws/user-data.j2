    This template generates the user-data that each instance receives at
    startup. Its primary purpose is to download pre-generated SSH host
    keys from S3 and install them.

    We need awscli to download the keys from S3. (It would be nice to
    use curl, but S3's HTTP download URLs may sometimes issue redirects
    in an XML format that curl cannot act upon.)

    TPA-generated AMIs include awscli already. For other instances, we
    can install the latest awscli-bundle.zip. To do this, we will need
    to install some packages (e.g., curl) in a platform-specific way.
    (Unfortunately, we can figure out what the target AMI is only by
    string matching against the AMI name.)

    Once awscli is available, we can just replace the SSH host keys.
