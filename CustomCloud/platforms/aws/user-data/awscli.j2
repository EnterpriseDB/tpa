    If awscli is not available, install it from the latest bundle.

    Why don't we pip install awscli? On RHEL, we have to first enable
    the EPEL repository to install python-pip (fine), but the install
    then fails because libyaml is not installed by default.

    Why don't we use operating system packages? The RHEL awscli package
    doesn't install because of a dependency on python-docutils that is
    apparently not available by default even in EPEL.
