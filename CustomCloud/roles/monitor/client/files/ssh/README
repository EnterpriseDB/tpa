NOTE: the `id_2ndq_nsca_gateway` key is for use on clients who require
submission of nsca-ng messages via a gateway server (e.g. landp, eurid).
It is used for passwordless inter-server communication on the
client's network, so is not encrypted or password protected.

DO NOT use this key for any other purpose.
