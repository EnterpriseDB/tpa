# Clients provide a client ID (think: user name) and a password.  The same
# ID/password combination may be used by multiple clients.  In order to
# authorize clients to submit check results and/or other external commands, at
# least one "authorize" section must be specified.  The client ID (which follows
# the "authorize" keyword) may be "*".  In this case, the block will be used as
# fallback if no section is defined for a given client ID.  No other wildcard
# characters are available, and "*" has no special meaning unless the client ID
# is exactly "*".
#
# Authorizations are specified using the "commands", "hosts, and/or "services"
# variables within an "authorize" section.  These variables are (lists of)
# extended POSIX regular expressions (see the regex(7) man page), but with an
# implicit leading "^" and trailing "$".  The "commands" patterns are matched
# against the full command string transmitted by the client, except for the
# leading bracketed timestamp.  The "hosts" and "services" variables are
# syntactic sugar, e.g.:
#
# 	services = {
# 		"http@web-server",
# 		"disk"
# 	}
#
# is equivalent to
#
# 	commands = {
# 		"PROCESS_SERVICE_CHECK_RESULT;web-server;http;.+;.+",
# 		"PROCESS_SERVICE_CHECK_RESULT;[^;]+;disk;.+;.+"
# 	}
#
# Some examples:
#
# Authenticated "root" clients may submit arbitrary check results and any other
# monitoring commands.
#
# 	authorize "root" {
# 		password = "cM5vBM9CtCWTH1SwnxFEOfp8VAmQq2vd"
# 		commands = ".*"
# 	}
#
# Authenticated "checker" clients may submit arbitrary check results, but no
# other commands.
#
# 	authorize "checker" {
# 		password = "s2LDCy4CiK6yrlcHhTXT6agFh067XYE3"
# 		hosts = ".*"
# 		services = ".*"
# 	}
#
# Authenticated "mail-checker" clients may submit check results for arbitrary
# services on hosts whose names begin with "pop", "imap", or "smtp".
#
# 	authorize "mail-checker" {
# 		password = "1HOiwYonRoLByCaX6lfY5KDhP484THzV"
# 		services = {
# 			".+@pop.*",
# 			".+@imap.*",
# 			".+@smtp.*"
# 		}
# 	}
#
# Authenticated "system-checker" clients may submit check results for the
# "disk", "swap", and "load" services on arbitrary hosts.
#
# 	authorize "system-checker" {
# 		password = "rDCnSMFaM9wb5Yzjd6JwRcvHEwmC9ZlQ"
# 		services = {
# 			"disk",
# 			"swap",
# 			"load"
# 		}
# 	}
#

#
# The "*" section applies when no other section matches the client's identity.
# In order to authorize clients to actually submit check results (or other
# commands), at least one "commands" and/or "services" expression must be
# specified.
#
# authorize "*" {
# 	password = "change-me"
# 	#
# 	# The original NSCA server permits all authenticated clients to submit
# 	# arbitrary check results.  To get this behaviour, enable the following
# 	# lines:
# 	#
# 	# 	hosts = ".*"
# 	# 	services = ".*"
# }
