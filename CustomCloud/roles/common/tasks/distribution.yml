# If ansible_distribution is not specified in the inventory, we perform
# "lightweight" distribution detection. We support Debian, RedHat, and
# Ubuntuâ€”and we aren't worried about detecting older versions of these
# platforms accurately (since we control what runs on the machines).
#
# We can't rely on there being a usable Python installed yet.
