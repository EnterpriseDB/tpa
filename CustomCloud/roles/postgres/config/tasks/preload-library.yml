# This file is meant to be included directly from outside the
# postgres/config role. It expects to be passed the name and (properly
# quoted) value of a postgresql.conf parameter, and will write a file
# into the Postgres include_dir.
#
# We wouldn't have to repeat the definition of _include_dir here if we
# could use include_role/tasks_from to invoke this, but that will have
# to wait until include_role is no longer so broken.

    that:
      - library is defined

# We're willing to be a bit flexible about what we read in here. We
# accept multiple lines setting shared_preload_libraries (last one
# wins), and commented-out assignments are ignored.
