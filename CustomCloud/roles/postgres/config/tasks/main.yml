# These tasks are run on every Postgres primary instance.

# First, we generate pg_hba.conf. There are several options here:
#
# 1. You can leave the existing pg_hba.conf alone. To do this, just set
#    postgres_hba_template to ''.
# 2. You can set postgres_hba_template to 'pg_hba.lines.j2' and specify
#    an array of lines in postgres_hba_settings; then pg_hba.conf will
#    contain the lines you specify, and no other rules.
# 3. The default postgres_hba_template 'pg_hba.conf.j2' will generate a
#    sensible configuration for the cluster. Any extra lines you specify
#    in postgres_hba_settings will be appended to these defaults.
# 4. You can set postgres_hba_template to something else and do whatever
#    you want in the custom template.
#
# These methods are all useful in different circumstances.

- name: Install pg_hba.conf
  template:
    src: "{{ postgres_hba_template }}"
    dest: "{{ postgres_conf_dir }}/pg_hba.conf"
  when: postgres_hba_template != ''

# Next, we generate postgresql.conf if the caller specifies a template.
# Otherwise, we leave the default postgresql.conf alone.

- name: Install postgresql.conf from postgres_conf_template (optional)
  template:
    src: "{{ postgres_conf_template }}"
    dest: "{{ postgres_conf_dir }}/postgresql.conf"
  when: postgres_conf_template != ''

# No matter where the config file lives (and where it came from), we
# make it include a config dir in PGDATA.

- name: Create include_dir for extra configuration settings
  file:
    path: "{{ _include_dir }}"
    state: directory

- name: Enable include_dir in postgresql.conf
  lineinfile:
    dest: "{{ postgres_conf_dir }}/postgresql.conf"
    line: >-
      include_dir = '{{ _include_dir }}'
    insertafter: EOF
    state: present

# Now we can put any desired settings into conf.d, where they will
# override the defaults.

- name: Install default TPA configuration file
  template:
    src: tpa.conf.j2
    dest: "{{ _include_dir }}/0000-tpa.conf"
    owner: postgres
    group: postgres
    mode: 0644
  when: postgres_conf_template == ''

# If any settings were specified in postgres_conf_settings, we put that
# into a separate configuration file. Note that we expect values in this
# hash to be quoted properly; we don't try to quote them when writing
# out the configuration.

- name: Generate configuration based on postgres_conf_settings (optional)
  template:
    src: settings.conf.j2
    dest: "{{ _include_dir }}/8888-role-settings.conf"
    owner: postgres
    group: postgres
    mode: 0644
  when: postgres_conf_settings
    
# And here's a file where anyone can add extra settings that will have
# priority over our defaults, and will never be overwritten.

- name: Create empty configuration override file
  template:
    force: no
    src: override.conf.j2
    dest: "{{ _include_dir }}/9999-override.conf"
    owner: postgres
    group: postgres
    mode: 0644

# Finally, we generate the TLS certificates needed by Postgres.

- include: tls.yml
  tags: [postgres, tls]
