# Use with caution.
#
# This role changes the cloud-init configuration on base images to suit
# the needs of TPA. cloud-init is neither very smart nor very reliable,
# and it's poorly documented, so be very conservative here. Resist the
# temptation to make cloud-init do more stuff on new instances.
#
# Any other tasks related to very early configuration for pre-built
# images may also belong here.
#
# It's meant to be used from clusters/images when building new images,
# and is probably not a good idea to include in any "normal" playbook.

## Rename the default admin user.
#
# We could use lineinfile to change the default username in
# /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg:
#
# system_info:
#   default_user:
#     name: admin
#     …
#
# When an instance is booted with the new AMI, cloud-init will then
# presumably create the admin user. But the build instances launched
# from the base RHEL or Ubuntu AMIs will already have an ec2-user or
# ubuntu user, which we certainly don't want hanging around.

## Suppress SSH key generation
#
# cloud-init generates SSH host keys, which we then replace in the
# user-data script for every instance. Can we avoid that?

## General instance cleanup
#
# The user-data script and other parts of the deployment process may
# create files that we want to get rid of in the final image.
