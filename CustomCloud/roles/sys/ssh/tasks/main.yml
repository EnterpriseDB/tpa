# Enable password-less SSH access between all nodes for a given user.
#
# 1. sys/ssh/keygen generates keys/id_user{,.pub}.
# 2. sys/ssh/authorize installs the public key to authorized_keys.
# 3. sys/ssh/install installs the keypair to ~user/.ssh.
#
# All of the above are declared as dependencies of this role, so there's
# nothing to do here. You can just do:
#
# - role: sys/ssh
#   user: postgres
