class ChangeDescription:
    """Represents a list of changes to a Cluster.

    A change description comprises an optional title (e.g., "Transmogrify eel
    to giant bug") and zero or more individual items, each one describing some
    change (e.g., "Set number of wings to 42"). Each item may be a string or a
    ChangeDescription.

    For example,

        a = ChangeDescription(items=["x","y","z"])
        b = ChangeDescription(title="First subtask", items=["task",a])
        c = ChangeDescription(title="Top-level task", items=[b])

    would result in str(c) being

        * Top-level task
          * First subtask
            * task
            * x
            * y
            * z

    of any ChangeDescription that includes it."""
