    assortment of key-value settings (apart from the key-value settings attached
    to the locations, groups, and instances). It's an object representation that
    corresponds exactly to a config.yml file.

    A cluster comprises instances in one or more locations (read: data centres),
    and contains information used to construct an Ansible inventory (instances,
    groups, and associated variables) as well as information needed to provision
    cluster resources (which may or may not be platform-specific, and some of
    which may also be copied into the inventory).

    A cluster has a main inventory group (corresponding to cluster_vars) and one
    subgroup per location. Every instance belongs to the group for the location
    it is in, and inherits membership in the main group thereby."""
