This transmogrifier changes a PGD-Always-ON cluster running PGD version 5
from using pgd-proxy to Connection Manager(PGD 5.9+)
"""
# --- Rationale and Migration Strategy ---
#
# This transmogrifier handles the complex task of migrating a PGD 5 cluster's
# configuration from using the external pgd-proxy service to the modern,
# built-in Connection Manager. The logic must account for several variations
# in the source configuration file (config.yml).
#
# 1. Global vs. Local Routing Modes:
#    - Global Routing: `enable_proxy_routing` is defined once in the top-level
#      parent bdr_node_group.
#    - Local Routing: `enable_proxy_routing` is defined in each of the subgroups,
#      and the parent group does not have an `options` block.
#
# 2. Global Defaults vs. Per-Instance Overrides:
#    - Global settings (like `default_pgd_proxy_options`) are defined in
#      `cluster_vars` and serve as the base for the migration.
#    - Per-instance settings (`pgd_proxy_options`, `pgd_http_options`) can
#      override these defaults on specific nodes. This presents a challenge,
#      as the new Connection Manager settings are group-based, not instance-based.
#
# 3. What is Not Migrated (`bdr_node_options`):
#    - Settings like `route_priority` under `bdr_node_options` are fundamental
#      to the BDR node itself and remain valid for the built-in Connection
#      Manager. These are intentionally left untouched.
#
# The Migration Strategy:
# - The transmogrifier uses a "trigger-based" approach. It first determines
#   the routing mode (Global or Local) and then applies settings based on
#   that mode.
# - It migrates global default settings (ports, etc.) only into the group(s)
#   that have routing enabled.
# - It differentiates its logic based on the detected routing mode:
#   - In Global Routing mode, the top-level group is configured with both
#     `enable_raft: true` and `enable_routing: true`. All of its subgroups are
#     then explicitly set to `enable_routing: false`, while `enable_raft` is
#     enabled (respecting any pre-existing `false` values).
#   - In Local Routing mode, the state of the top-level group is made explicit
#     (typically `enable_raft: true`, `enable_routing: false`).
# - For backward compatibility, it preserves the original `enable_proxy_routing`
#   key, copying its value to the new `enable_routing` key. The legacy key
#   is removed in the subsequent upgrade to PGD-X.
# - A final corrective pass is made to enforce a critical PGD 5.9+ rule:
#   if any subgroup ends up with both `enable_routing: false` and
#   `enable_raft: false`, it forces `enable_raft` to `true`.
# - It detects per-instance overrides, prints a clear WARNING, and safely
#   removes the obsolete instance-level keys.
