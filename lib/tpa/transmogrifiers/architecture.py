"""
This transmogrifier acts as a dispatcher for handling architecture changes.
It owns the global --architecture flag and delegates work to the specialist
transmogrifiers for each specific upgrade path.
"""
# --- Why do we need this Dispatcher ---
#
# The `tpaexec` framework is designed to have a single, globally recognized
# `--architecture` flag that can be used by different transmogrifiers. However,
# the framework's test suite and help system load the options from all
# available transmogrifiers at once.
#
# The Problem:
# If multiple transmogrifiers (e.g., `bdr4pgd5.py` and `pgd5pgdx.py` or by
# extension any future additions to this list) each try to define their own
# `--architecture` option, it creates a "conflicting option string" error.
#
# The Solution:
# This `Architecture` transmogrifier acts as a central "dispatcher." It is the
# single, authoritative owner of the `--architecture` flag. Its only job is to
# inspect the cluster's source and target architecture and then delegate all
# work (`check`, `apply`, `description`) to the correct specialist
# transmogrifier. This resolves the conflict while working in harmony with the
# framework's design, creating a clean and scalable way to support multiple
# architecture upgrades.
#
# Trade-Off:
# The primary limitation of this pattern is that it introduces a dependency:
# any new transmogrifier that handles an architecture change *must* be
# manually registered within this dispatcher. However, the benefits of this
# approach are significant. It creates a single source of truth for all
# supported architecture upgrades and provides a clear, simple pattern for
# future extensions, which is a worthwhile trade-off for the added clarity
# and robustness.
