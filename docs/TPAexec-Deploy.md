TPA configuration guide - deploy
==================

Â© Copyright 2ndQuadrant, 2018. Confidential property of 2ndQuadrant; not for public release.

### Overview


This guide is designed to follow on from the TPA configuration guide - provision, and covers the deployment stage, which is the part that sets up a fully working database cluster with multiple nodes, replication and backup - all integrated and fully tested for both performance and high availability.

### Pre-requisite

You will need to have run the provision stage first ( **tpaexec provision \<clustername>** )  - see [TPAexec configuration guide - provision](https://github.com/2ndQuadrant/TPA/tree/master/docs/TPAexec-provision.md).

If you are not using a private repo for the deployment packages, you will need to specify a repo password for the relevant 2ndQuadrant repo [RHEL/Centos rpms](https://rpm-internal.2ndquadrant.com/site/content/) or [Debian/Ubunto deb packages](https://apt-internal.2ndquadrant.com/site/content/)
   ```
   export TPA_2Q_REPO_PASSWORD=putPASSWORDhere
   ```


### TPA cluster Deployment

In this document, we are continuing where [TPAexec configuration guide - provision](https://github.com/2ndQuadrant/TPA/blob/master/docs/TPAexec-provision.md) left off, and assuming that we have provisioned a new cluster **speedy**, with TPA config files in **~/tpa/clusters/test/speedy**. 

```
	$ ls ~/tpa/clusters/test/speedy
	certs       hostkeys       inventory    ssh_config  vault
	config.yml  id_speedy      keys         tmp
	deploy.yml  id_speedy.pub  known_hosts  vars.json
```

Looking in the inventory directory, we can see that a file called **00-speedy** has been created, containing the hostname information - this can be used to cross-check the information being used to build the servers.

```
	$ cat ~/tpa/clusters/speedy/inventory/00-speedy
	[tag_Cluster_speedy]
	speedy-a ansible_host=34.240.16.222 node=1
	speedy-b ansible_host=54.154.64.43 node=2
	speedy-c ansible_host=54.229.220.113 node=3
	speedy-d ansible_host=54.229.136.91 node=4
```



Before we can run **tpaexec deploy ~/tpa/clusters/speedy** we first need to edit **deploy.yml**

The file deploy.yml has been split into logical sections for the purposes of description

### Basic initialisation and fact discovery

```

# This play must always be applied to all hosts in the cluster. Here we
# do any platform-specific checks and initialisation, confirm that all
# hosts are available, and perform basic fast discovery.

### Cleanup /etc/hosts

This code block is there to ensure that a re-deployment works even when limited to a subset of hosts

```
# Finally, we must make sure we don't leave stale entries in /etc/hosts
# anywhere. (This won't matter for an initial deployment, because the
# role has already been applied above, but it will matter if we run a
# re-deployment limited to certain hosts.)

- name: Ensure /etc/hosts is correct cluster-wide
  any_errors_fatal: True
  max_fail_percentage: 0
  sudo_user: root
  sudo: yes
  hosts: all
  roles:
    - role: sys/hosts
      tags: [sys, hosts]
```

| - role:              | **sys/hosts** - Generates the /etc/hosts and /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts files. See  [TPA/roles/sys/hosts/tasks/main.yml](https://github.com/2ndQuadrant/TPA/tree/master/roles/sys/hosts/tasks/main.yml) for more info. |

### Deploy

Run **tpaexec deploy ~/tpa/clusters/speedy**

(Note, the previous method of running **$TPA_DIR/bin/deploy ~/tpa/clusters/speedy** will still work)
