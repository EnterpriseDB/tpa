tpaexec configure

### tpaexec configure

To be able to provision, deploy & rehydrate servers, **TPAexec** requires a pair of config files describing the instances to be present in a cluster directory. In order to create these, it is suggested that the **tpaexec configure** utility is used - it will create a **config.yml** which can then be edited, and a **deploy.yml** which is *not* designed to be edited. 

Before using this, it is suggested that you create a "clusters" directory into which individual cluster config directories can be created. 

```
[tpa]$ mkdir ~/tpa/clusters
```
**tpaexec configure \<clustername>** **\<options>** can be used to generate configs for different platforms like AWS, baremetal, and different architectures, like Single Master (a.k.a. M1), along with a range of options, which may be platform or architecture specific. The currently supported options can be found by running `tpaexec help configure-options`, and the currently available architectures can be found by running `tpaexec info architectures`.

### All current configuration options:

```
tpaexec configure <clustername> --architecture <arch> --platform <platform> 
--region <region> --[subnet <CIDR> | --subnet-pattern <pattern>] 
--instance-type <instance type> [--distribution [RedHat|Debian|Ubuntu] 
--minimal | --os [Debian-minimal|RedHat-minimal|Ubuntu-minimal]] 
--postgres-version [10|9.6] --postgres-package-version <ver>
--repmgr-package-version <ver> --barman-package-version <ver>
--pglogical-package-version <ver> --bdr-package-version <ver>
--pgbouncer-package-version <ver>
--hostnames-from <filename> --hostnames-pattern <pattern>
```

```
<clustername> - directory name to be created for the cluster. Examples:
~/tpa/clusters/speedy
./speedy
/home/tpa/tpa/clusters/speedy
```
### Architecture options

```
--architecture <arch> - M1|BDR-Always-ON|Training
M1: Postgres with streaming replication (M1 is single master - one primary, n replicas).
BDR-Always-ON: Bi Directional Replication in an Always-ON configuration 
   (2ndQuadrant internal use only, still in development, and requires access 
to internal repositories)
Training: Creates clusters for 2ndQuadrant training sessions (Designed for
   2ndQuadrant use; unsupported)
```
### Platform options

```
--platform <platform> - bare|aws|lxd
bare: Servers accessible via SSH (e.g., bare metal, or already-provisioned 
   servers on any cloud provider).
aws: AWS EC2 instances (This is the default, if --platform not present)
lxd: lxd containers (Unsupported; still in development)
```

```
--region <region> - AWS region (Defaults to eu-west-1). 
* Specific to --platform aws
```

```
--instance-type <instance type> - AWS instance type (Defaults to t2.micro). 
* Specific to --platform aws
```
### Subnet selection

```
--subnet <CIDR> - By default, each cluster is assigned a random /28 subnet 
   under 10.33/16, but depending on the architecture, there may be one or more 
   subnets, and each subnet may be anywhere between a /24 and a /29.
```

```
--subnet-pattern <pattern> - You may instead specify --subnet-pattern 192.0.x.x 
   to generate random subnets (as many as required by the architecture) matching 
   the given pattern.
```
### Distribution

```
--distribution [RedHat|Debian|Ubuntu] (Defaults to Debian)
```

```
--minimal - Use the stock distribution images instead of TPA images that have 
   Postgres and other software preinstalled.
```

```
--os [RedHat-minimal|Debian-minimal|Ubuntu-minimal] - this option can be used 
   instead of the previous 2 options (--distribution and --minimal)
```
### Software versions.

By default, we always install the latest version of every package. This is usually 
the desired behaviour, but in some testing scenarios, it may be necessary to 
select specific package versions.

```
--postgres-version [10|9.6] - 10 is the default, 9.6 is also supported. 
   Versions 9.4 and 9.5 are no longer actively maintained.
```

```
--postgres-package-version <pkg> - Specific postgres package, e.g. 10.4-2.pgdg90+1
--repmgr-package-version <pkg> - Specific repmgr package, e.g. 4.0.5-1.pgdg90+1
--barman-package-version <pkg> - Specific barman package, e.g. 2.4-1.pgdg90+1
--pgbouncer-package-version <pkg> - Specific pgbouncer package, e.g. '1.8*'
--pglogical-package-version <pkg> - Specific pglogical package, e.g. '2.2.0*'
--bdr-package-version <pkg> - Specific bdr package, e.g. '3.0.2*'
```
### Hostnames.

By default, ``tpaexec configure`` will randomly select as many hostnames
as it needs from a pre-approved list of several dozen names. This should
be enough for most clusters.

```
--hostnames-from <filename> - select names from a different list 
   (e.g., if you need more names than are available in the canned list). 
   The file must contain one hostname per line.
```
```
--hostnames-pattern <pattern> - restrict hostnames to those matching 
   the egrep-syntax pattern. If you choose to do this, you must ensure that 
   the pattern matches only valid hostnames (``[a-zA-Z0-9-]``) and that it 
   finds a sufficient number thereof.
```

------

### Simple example:

```
tpaexec configure ~/tpa/clusters/speedy --architecture M1
```

This will create config files that can be used to provision and deploy a 4 node M1 AWS cluster in AWS region `eu-west-1`, with each node of type `t2.micro`. The AMIs have defaulted to `TPA-Debian-PGDG-10-2018*`

```
[tpa]$ ls ~/tpa/clusters/speedy3
config.yml  deploy.yml
[tpa]$ head -35 ~/tpa/clusters/speedy3/config.yml
