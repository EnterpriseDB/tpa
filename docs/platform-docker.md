Docker
======

TPAexec has experimental support for Docker.

Please consult the
[Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com) if you need help to
[install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install) and
[get started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) with it.

The [ansible module documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/docker_container_module.html)
may also be helpful.

At the moment, this platform supports only the centos/systemd image
(based on CentOS 7).
