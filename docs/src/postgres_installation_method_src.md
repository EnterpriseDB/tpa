description: Building Postgres from source using TPA.
---

# Postgres source installation

TPA will compile and install Postgres from source if you set
`postgres_installation_method` to `src`. This feature is meant for use
in development and testing, and allows you to switch between packaged
and source builds within an identically-configured cluster.

Even here, you do not need to change the defaults, which will give you a
working cluster with debugging enabled.

## Git repository

The default settings will build and install Postgres from the community
Git repository, using the `REL_xx_STABLE` branch corresponding to your
`postgres_version`. You can specify a different repository or branch
(any valid git reference) as follows:

```yaml
cluster_vars:
  postgres_git_url: git://git.postgresql.org/git/postgresql.git
  postgres_git_ref: REL_12_STABLE
```

The default git.postgresql.org repository does not require
authentication, but if necessary, you can use
[SSH agent forwarding or an HTTPS username/password](git-credentials.md)
to authenticate to other repositories.

The repository will be cloned into `postgres_src_dir` (default:
`/opt/postgres/src/postgres`), or updated with `git pull` if the
directory already exists (e.g., if you are re-deploying).

### Build customisation

By default, TPA will configure and build Postgres with debugging
enabled and sensible defaults in `postgres_build_dir` (default:
`/opt/postgres/build/postgres`). You can change various settings to
customise the build:

```yaml
cluster_vars:
  postgres_extra_configure_env:
    CFLAGS: "-O3"
  postgres_extra_configure_opts:
    - --with-llvm
    - --disable-tap-tests
```

This will run `./configure` with the options in
`postgres_extra_configure_opts` and the settings from
`postgres_extra_configure_env` defined in the environment. Some
options are specified by default (e.g., `--with-debug`), but can be
negated by the corresponding `--disable-xxx` or `--without-xxx`
options. Building `--without-openssl` is not supported.

If required, you can also change the following default build commands:

```yaml
cluster_vars:
  postgres_make_command: "make -s"
  postgres_build_targets:
    - "all"
    - "-C contrib all"
  postgres_install_targets:
    - "install"
    - "-C contrib install"
```

Run `tpaexec deploy â€¦ --skip-tags build-clean` in order to reuse the
build directory when doing repeated deploys. (Otherwise the old build
directory is emptied before starting the build.) You can also configure
[local source directories](configure-source.md#local-source-directories)
to speed up your development builds.

Whenever you run a source build, Postgres will be restarted.

## Additional components

Even if you install Postgres from packages, you can compile and install
extensions from source. There's a separate page about how to configure
[`install_from_source`](install_from_source.md).

If you install Postgres from source, however, you will need to install
extensions from source as well, because the extension packages typically
depend on the Postgres package(s) being installed.

## Package installation

There's a separate page about
[installing Postgres and Postgres-related packages](postgres_installation_method_pkg.md)
with `postgres_installation_method: pkg` (the default).
