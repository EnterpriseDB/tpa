description: Which Linux distributions are supported by TPA.

# Distribution support

TPA detects and adapts to the distribution running on each target
instance. This page lists platforms which are actively supported and
'legacy distribution' which have previously been supported. Deploying to a
legacy platform is likely to work as long as you have access to the
necessary packages, but this is not considered a supported use of TPA
and is not suitable for production use.

Fully supported platforms are supported both as host systems for running
TPA and target systems on which TPA deploys the Postgres cluster.

containers](platform-docker.md).
