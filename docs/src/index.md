## Introduction

TPA is an orchestration tool that uses Ansible to deploy Postgres
clusters according to EDB's recommendations.

TPA embodies the best practices followed by EDB, informed by many years
of hard-earned experience with deploying and supporting Postgres. These
recommendations apply to quick testbed setups as well as
production environments.

## What can TPA do?

TPA is built around a declarative configuration mechanism that you can
use to describe a Postgres cluster, from its topology to the
smallest details of its configuration.

Start by running `tpaexec configure` to generate an initial cluster
configuration based on a few high-level choices, such as the Postgres
version to install. The default configuration is ready to use as is,
but you can edit it to suit your needs. (The generated configuration is
a text file, `config.yml`).

Using this configuration, TPA can:

1. Provision servers, for example, AWS EC2 instances or Docker containers, and
   any other resources needed to host the cluster. Or you can deploy to
   existing servers or VMs just by specifying connection details.

2. Configure the operating system, for example, tweak kernel settings, create users
   and SSH keys, install packages, define systemd services, set up log
   rotation, and so on.

3. Install and configure Postgres and associated components, such as PGD,
   Barman, pgbouncer, repmgr, and various Postgres extensions.

4. Run automated tests on the cluster after deployment.

5. Deploy future changes to your configuration, such as changing Postgres
   settings, installing and upgrading packages, adding new servers, and
   so on.

## How do you use it?

To use TPA, you need to install it and run the `tpaexec setup` command.
Follow the [installation instructions](INSTALL.md) for your platform.

TPA operates in four stages to bring up a Postgres cluster:

* Generate a cluster [configuration](#configuration).
* [Provision](#provisioning) servers (VMs, containers) to host the cluster.
* [Deploy](#deployment) software to the provisioned instances.
* [Test](#testing) the deployed cluster.

```bash
# 1. Configuration: decide what kind of cluster you want
[tpa]$ tpaexec configure clustername --architecture M1 --platform aws \
        --postgresql 14 \
        --failover-manager repmgr

# 2. Provisioning: create the servers needed to host the cluster
[tpa]$ tpaexec provision clustername

# 3. Deployment: install and configure the necessary software
[tpa]$ tpaexec deploy clustername

# 4. Testing: make sure everything is working as expected
[tpa]$ tpaexec test clustername
```

You can run TPA from your laptop, an EC2 instance, or any machine
that can reach the cluster's servers over the network.

For more information, see [TPA capabilities and supported software](tpaexec-support.md).

### Configuration

The [`tpaexec configure`](tpaexec-configure.md)
command generates a simple YAML configuration file to describe a
cluster, based on the options you select. The configuration is ready for
immediate use, but you can modify it to better suit your needs. Editing
the configuration file is the usual way to [make any configuration
changes to your cluster](configure-cluster.md), both before and after
it's created.

At this stage, you must select an architecture and a platform for the
cluster. An *architecture* is a recommended layout of servers and
software to set up Postgres for a specific purpose. Examples include
M1 (Postgres with a primary and streaming replicas) and
PGD-Always-ON (EDB Postgres Distributed 5 in an Always On
configuration). A *platform* is a means to host the servers to deploy
any architecture, for example, AWS, Docker, or bare-metal servers.

### Provisioning

The [`tpaexec provision`](tpaexec-provision.md)
command creates instances and other resources required by the cluster.
The details of the process depend on the architecture (for example, M1) and
platform (for example, AWS) that you selected while configuring the cluster.

For example, given AWS access with the necessary privileges, TPA
provisions EC2 instances, VPCs, subnets, routing tables, internet
gateways, security groups, EBS volumes, elastic IPs, and so on.

You can also provision existing servers by selecting the bare
platform and providing connection details. Whether these are bare metal
servers or those provisioned separately on a cloud platform, they can be
used as if they were created by TPA.

You aren't restricted to a single platform. You can spread your cluster
out across some AWS instances (in multiple regions) and some on-premises
servers or servers in other data centers as needed.

At the end of the provisioning stage, you have the required number
of instances with the basic operating system installed, which TPA
can access by way of SSH (with sudo to root).

### Deployment

The [`tpaexec deploy`](tpaexec-deploy.md)
command installs and configures Postgres and other software on the
provisioned servers. (These servers can be created by TPA, but they don't have to be.
It doesn't matter which application created them as long as SSH and sudo access is
available.) This includes setting up replication, backups, and so on.

At the end of the deployment stage, Postgres is up and running.

### Testing

The [`tpaexec test`](tpaexec-test.md) command executes various
architecture and platform-specific tests against the deployed cluster to
ensure that it's working as expected.

At the end of the testing stage, you have a fully functioning
cluster.

### Incremental changes

TPA is carefully designed so that provisioning, deployment, and
testing are idempotent. You can run through them, make a change to
`config.yml`, and run through the process again to deploy the change. If
nothing changed in the configuration or on the instances, then
rerunning the entire process doesn't change anything either.

### Cluster management

Once your cluster is up and running, TPA provides convenient cluster
management functions, including configuration changes, switchover, and
zero-downtime minor-version upgrades. These features make it easier and
safer to manage your cluster than making the changes by hand.

### Extensible through Ansible

TPA supports a [variety of configuration
options](configure-instance.md), so you can do a lot just by editing
`config.yml` and rerunning provision/deploy/test. If you do need to go
beyond what TPA already supports, you can write:

* [Custom commands](tpaexec-commands.md), which make it simple to write
  playbooks to run on the cluster. Create
  `commands/xyz.yml` in your cluster directory, and invoke it
  using `tpaexec xyz /path/to/cluster`. Custom commands are ideal for any management tasks
  or processes that you need to automate.

* [Custom tests](tpaexec-tests.md), which augment the builtin tests with
  in-depth verifications specific to your environment and application.
  Using `tpaexec test` to run all tests in a uniform, repeatable way
  ensures that you don't miss out on anything important, either when
  dealing with a crisis or during routine cluster management.

* [Hook scripts](tpaexec-hooks.md), which are invoked during various
  stages of the deployment. For example, tasks in `hooks/pre-deploy.yml`
  are run before the main deployment. There are many other hooks,
  including `post-deploy`. Using hook scripts gives you easy access to 
  the full range of Ansible functionality.

## It's just Postgres

TPA can create complex clusters with many features configured, but
the result is just Postgres. The installation follows some conventions
designed to make life simpler, but there's no hidden magic or anything
standing in the way between you and the database. You can do everything
on a TPA cluster that you can do on any other Postgres installation.

## Versioning in TPA

TPA previously used a date-based versioning scheme whereby the major
version was derived from the year. From version 23, we moved to a
derivative of semantic versioning. For historical reasons, we aren't
using the full three-part semantic version number. Instead TPA uses a
two-part `major.minor` format. The minor version is incremented on every
release. The major version is incremented only when required to comply
with the backward compatibility principle that follows.

### Backward compatibility

A key development principle of TPA is to maintain backward
compatibility so there's no reason for users to need anything other
than the latest version of TPA. We define backward compatibility as
follows:

- A `config.yml` created with TPA X.a is valid with TPA X.b, where
  b>=a.
- The cluster created from that `config.yml` can be maintained and
  redeployed with TPA X.b.

 Therefore, a new major version implies a break in backward
 compatibility. As such, we aim to avoid releasing major versions and
 do so only in exceptional circumstances.

 ## Getting started

Follow the [TPA installation instructions](INSTALL.md) for your
system. Then [configure your first cluster](tpaexec-configure.md).
