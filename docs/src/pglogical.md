# pglogical

## pglogical package version

By default, TPA installs the latest available version of `pglogical`.

The version of the `pglogical` package that is installed can be specified 
by including `pglogical_package_version: xxx` under the `cluster_vars` 
section of the `config.yml` file.

```yaml
cluster_vars:
    …
    pglogical_package_version: '2.2.0*'
    …
```

You may use any version specifier that apt or yum would accept.

If your version does not match, try appending a `*` wildcard. This
is often necessary when the package version has an epoch qualifier
like `2:...`.

## pglogical configuration

TPA can configure pglogical replication sets (publications) and
subscriptions with pglogical v2 and pglogical v3.

```yaml
instances:
- node: 1
  Name: kazoo
  …
  vars:
    publications:
    - type: pglogical
      database: example
      name: some_publication_name
      replication_sets:
      - name: custom_replication_set
        …

- node: 2
  Name: keeper
  vars:
    subscriptions:
    - type: pglogical
      database: example
      name: some_subscription_name
      publication:
        name: some_publication_name
      replication_sets:
        - default
        - default_insert_only
        - custom_replication_set
      …
```

The pglogical extension will be created by default if you define
publications or subscriptions with `type: pglogical`, but it is up to
you to determine which version will be installed (e.g., subscribe to the
`products/pglogical3/release` repository for pglogical3).

## Introduction

TPA can configure everything needed to replicate changes between
instances using pglogical, and can also alter the replication setup
based on config.yml changes.

To publish changes, you define an entry with `type: pglogical` in
`publications`. To subscribe to these changes, you define an entry
with `type: pglogical` in `subscriptions`, as shown above.

Pglogical does not have a named publication entity (in the sense that
built-in logical replication has `CREATE PUBLICATION`). A publication
in config.yml just assigns a name to a collection of replication sets,
and subscriptions can use this name to refer to the desired provider.

To use pglogical replication, both publishers and subscribers need a
named local pglogical node. TPA will create this node with
`pglogical.create_node()` if it does not exist. For publications, the
publication name is used as the pglogical node name. There can be only
one pglogical node in any given database, so you can have only one entry
in `publications` per database.

However, pglogical subscriptions *do* have a name of their own. TPA
will create subscriptions with the given `name`, and use a default
value for the pglogical node name based on the instance's name and the
name of the database in which the subscription is created. You can
specify a different `node_name` if required—for example, when you have
configured a publication in the same database, so that all subscriptions
in that database must share the same pglogical node.

TPA does some basic validation of the configuration—it will point
out the error if you spell `replication_sets` as `replciation_sets`, or
try to subscribe to a publication that is not defined, but it is your
responsibility to specify a meaningful set of publications and
subscriptions.

TPA will configure pglogical after creating users, extensions, and
databases, but before any PGD configuration. You can set
[`postgres_users`](postgres_users.md) and
[`postgres_databases`](postgres_databases.md) to create databases
for replication, and use the
[`postgres-config-final`](tpaexec-hooks.md#postgres-config-final)
hook to populate the databases before pglogical is configured.

## Publications

An entry in `publications` must specify a `name` and `database`,
and may specify a list of named `replication_sets` with optional
attributes, as well as a list of table or sequence names.

```yaml
publications:
- type: pglogical
  database: example
  name: some_publication_name
  replication_sets:
  - name: default
    replicate_insert: true
    replicate_update: true
    replicate_delete: true
    replicate_truncate: true
    autoadd_tables: false
    autoadd_sequences: false
    autoadd_existing: true
  - name: custom_replication_set
    tables:
    - name: sometable
    - name: '"some-schema".othertable'
      columns: [a, b, c]
      row_filter: 'a > 42'
      synchronize_data: true
    sequences:
    - name: someseq
      synchronize_data: true
    - name: '"some-schema".otherseq'
```

Each replication set may specify optional attributes such as
`replicate_insert` and `autoadd_existing`. If specified, they will
be included as named parameters in the call to
`pglogical.create_replication_set()`, otherwise they will be left out
and the replication set will be created with pglogical's defaults instead.

Apart from manipulating the list of relations belonging to the
replication set using the `autoadd_*` parameters in pglogical3, you
can also explicitly specify a list of tables or sequences. The name of
each relation may be schema-qualified (unqualified names are assumed to
be in `public`), and the entry may include optional attributes such as
`row_filter` (for tables only) or `synchronize_data`, as shown
above.

## Subscriptions

An entry in `subscriptions` must specify a `name` and `database`,
define a publication to subscribe to, and may specify other optional
attributes of the subscription.

```yaml
subscriptions:
- type: pglogical
  database: example
  name: some_subscription_name
  node_name: optional_pglogical_node_name
  publication:
    name: some_publication_name
  # Optional attributes:
  synchronize_structure: true
  synchronize_data: true
  forward_origins: ['all']
  strip_origins: false
  apply_delay: '1 second'
  writer: 'heap'
  writer_options:
    - 'magic'
    - 'key=value'
    - 'just-a-string'
  # Optional attributes that can be changed for an existing
  # subscription:
  replication_sets:
    - default
    - default_insert_only
    - custom_replication_set
  enabled: true
```

A subscription can set `publication.name` (as shown above) to define
which publication to subscribe to. If there is more than one publication
with that name (across the entire cluster), you may specify the name of
an instance to disambiguate. If you want to refer to publications by
name, don't create multiple publications with the same name on the same
instance.

```yaml
- type: pglogical
  …
  publication:
    name: some_publication_name
    instance: kazoo

  # OR

  provider_dsn: "host=… dbname=…"
```

Instead of referring to publications by name, you may explicitly specify
a `provider_dsn` instead. In this case, the given DSN is passed to
`pglogical.create_subscription()` directly (and `publication` is
ignored). You can use this mechanism to subscribe to instances outside
the TPA cluster.

The other attributes in the example above are optional. If defined, they
will be included as named parameters in the call to
`pglogical.create_subscription()`, otherwise they will be left out.
(Some attributes shown are specific to pglogical3.)

## Configuration changes

For publications, you can add or remove replication sets, change the
attributes of a replication set, or change its membership (the tables
and sequences it contains).

If you change `replicate_*` or `autoadd_*`, TPA will call
`pglogical.alter_replication_set()` accordingly (but note that you
cannot change `autoadd_existing` for existing replication sets, and
the `autoadd_*` parameters are all pglogical3-specific).

If you change the list of `tables` or `sequences` for a replication
set, TPA will reconcile these changes by calling
`pglogical.alter_replication_set_{add,remove}_{table,sequence}()` as
needed.

However, if you change `synchronize_data` or other attributes for a
relation (table or sequence) that is already a member of a replication
set, TPA will not propagate the changes (e.g., by dropping the table
and re-adding it with a different configuration).

For subscriptions, you can only change the list of `replication_sets`
and enable or disable the subscription (`enabled: false`).

In both cases, any replication sets that exist but are not mentioned in
the configuration will be removed (with
`pglogical.alter_subscription_remove_replication_set()` on the
subscriber, or `pglogical.drop_replication_set()` on the
publisher—but the default replication sets named `default`,
`default_insert_only`, and `ddl_sql` will not be dropped.)

If you edit config.yml, remember to run `tpaexec provision` before
running `tpaexec deploy`.

## Interaction with PGD

It is possible to use PGD and pglogical together in the same database if
you exercise caution.

PGD v3 uses pglogical3 internally, and will create a pglogical node if
one does not exist. There can be only one pglogical node per database,
so if you configure a pglogical publication in `bdr_database`, the
instance's `bdr_node_name` must be the same as the publication's `name`.
Otherwise, the node will be created for the publication first, and
`bdr.create_node()` will fail later with an error about a node name
conflict. Any `subscriptions` in `bdr_database` must use the same
`node_name` too.

## Limitations

* There is currently no support for
  `pglogical.replication_set_{add,remove}_ddl()`

* There is currently no support for
  `pglogical.replication_set_add_all_{tables,sequences}()`

* There is currently no support for
  `pglogical.alter_subscription_{interface,writer_options}()` or
  `pglogical.alter_subscription_{add,remove}_log()`

* pglogical v1 support is not presently tested.
