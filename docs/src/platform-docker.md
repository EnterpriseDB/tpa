# Docker

TPA can create Docker containers and deploy a cluster to them. At
present, it sets up containers to run systemd and other services as if
they were ordinary VMs.

Deploying to docker containers is an easy way to test different cluster
configurations. It is not meant for production use.

## Synopsis

Just select the platform at configure-time:

```bash
[tpa]$ tpaexec configure clustername --platform docker […]
[tpa]$ tpaexec provision clustername
[tpa]$ tpaexec deploy clustername
```

## Operating system selection

Use the standard `--os Debian/Ubuntu/RedHat/SLES` configure option to
select which distribution to use for the containers. TPA will build
its own systemd-enabled images for this distribution. These images will
be named with a `tpa/` prefix, e.g., `tpa/redhat:8`.

Use `--os-image some/image:name` to specify an existing
systemd-enabled image instead. For example, the
[centos/systemd](https://hub.docker.com/r/centos/systemd/)
image (based on CentOS 7) can be used in this way.

TPA does not support Debian 8 (jessie) or Ubuntu 16.04 (xenial) for
Docker containers, because of bugs in the old version of systemd shipped
on those distributions.

## Installing Docker

We test TPA with the latest stable Docker-CE packages.

This documentation assumes that you have a working Docker installation,
and are familiar with basic operations such as pulling images and
creating containers.

Please consult the
[Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com) if you need help to
[install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and
[get started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) with it.

On MacOS X, you can [install "Docker Desktop for
Mac"](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac/)
and launch Docker from the application menu.

### CgroupVersion

Support for CgroupVersion 2 is not fully baked yet for docker sdk in
ansible and related tooling. So while we recommend using a recent
version of docker; we rely on CgroupVersion 1 until version 2 is
fully supported. Instructions below suggest the changes to switch to
CgroupVersion 1 if your platform uses CgroupVersion 2 by default.

On Linux:
```
$ echo 'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=false' > \
  /etc/default/grub.d/cgroup.cfg
$ update-grub
$ reboot
```
On MacOS:

1. Edit ~/Library/Group\ Containers/group.com.docker/settings.json
   and make the following replacement
   `"deprecatedCgroupv1": false` → `"deprecatedCgroupv1": true`
2. Restart Docker Desktop app

### Permissions

TPA expects the user running it to have permission to access to the
Docker daemon (typically by being a member of the `docker` group that
owns `/var/run/docker.sock`). Run a command like this to check if you
have access:

```bash
[tpa]$ docker version --format '{{.Server.Version}}'
19.03.12
```

**WARNING**: Giving a user the ability to speak to the Docker daemon
lets them trivially gain root on the Docker host. Only trusted users
should have access to the Docker daemon.

### Docker container privileges

#### Privileged containers

By default TPA provisions Docker containers in unprivileged mode, with no
added Linux capabilities flags. Such containers cannot manage host firewall
rules, file systems, block devices, or most other tasks that require true root
privileges on the host.

If you require your containers to run in privileged mode, set the `privileged`
boolean variable for the instance(s) that need it, or globally in
`instance_defaults`, e.g.:

    instance_defaults:
      privileged: true

**WARNING**: Running containers in privileged mode allows the root user or any
process that can gain root to load kernel modules, modify host firewall rules,
escape the container namespace, or otherwise act much as the real host "root"
user would. Do not run containers in priviliged mode unless you really need to.

See `man capabilities` for details on Linux capabilities flags.

#### `security_opts` and the `no-new-privileges` flag

tpaexec can start docker containers in a restricted mode where processes cannot
increase their privileges. setuid binaries are restricted, etc. Enable this in
tpaexec with the `instance_defaults` or per-container variable
`docker_security_opts`:

    instance_defaults:
      docker_security_opts:
        - no-new-privileges

Other arguments to `docker run`'s `--security-opts` are also accepted, e.g.
SELinux user and role.

#### Linux capabilities flags

tpaexec exposes Docker's control over Linux capabilities flags with the
`docker_cap_add` list variable, which may be set per-container or in
`instance_defaults`. See `man capabilities`, the `docker run` documentation and
the documentation for the Ansible `docker_containers` module for details on
capabilities flags.

Docker's `--cap-drop` is also supported via the `docker_cap_drop` list.

For example, to run a container as unprivileged, but give it the ability to
modify the system clock, you might write:

    instance_defaults:
      privileged: false
      docker_cap_add:
        - sys_time
      docker_cap_drop:
        - all

### Docker storage configuration

**Caution**: The default Docker configuration on many hosts uses
`lvm-loop` block storage and is not suitable for production
deployments. Run `docker info` to check which storage driver you are
using. If you are using the loopback scheme, you will see something
like this:

```
 Storage Driver: devicemapper
  …
  Data file: /dev/loop0
```

Consult the Docker documentation for more information on storage
configuration:

* [Storage Drivers](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/)
* [Configuring lvm-direct for production](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/device-mapper-driver/#configure-direct-lvm-mode-for-production)

## Docker container management

All of the docker containers in a cluster can be started and stopped
together using the `start-containers` and `stop-containers` commands:

```bash
[tpa]$ tpaexec start-containers clustername
[tpa]$ tpaexec stop-containers clustername
```

These commands don't provision or deprovision containers, or even
connect to them; they are intended to save resources when you're
temporarily not using a docker cluster that you need to keep
available for future use.

For a summary of the provisioned docker containers in a cluster,
whether started or stopped, use the `list-containers` command:

```bash
[tpa]$ tpaexec list-containers clustername
```
