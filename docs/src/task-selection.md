description: Selecting which tasks TPA should run during deployment.

# Selective task execution

## Using task selectors

You can tell TPA to run only a subset of the tasks that constitute a
full deployment using the `--excluded_tasks` and `--included_tasks`
options to `tpaexec deploy`. Each of these arguments is a
string treated as a comma-separated list of selectors. Equivalently, you can set the
`excluded_tasks` and `included_tasks` variables in `config.yml`, either
for the whole cluster or for the separate instances. In `config.yml`,
you can use either a comma-separated string or a yaml list.

Tasks matched by `excluded_tasks` are always excluded. If you specify
`included_tasks`, then non-matching tasks are implicitly excluded.

Some selectors may be used in either list, and some only in the
`excluded_tasks` list, as detailed below. A separate set of selectors is
available for `tpaexec test`.

## Examples

To deploy without running barman-related tasks:

```
[tpa]$ tpaexec deploy <clustername> --excluded_tasks=barman
```

To deploy running only repmgr-related tasks:

```
[tpa]$ tpaexec deploy <clustername> --included_tasks=repmgr
```

To deploy without trying to set hostnames on the instances:

```
[tpa]$ tpaexec deploy <clustername> --excluded_tasks=hostname
```

To prevent bootstrap and ssh tasks from ever running, put the following
into `config.yml`:

```yaml
    cluster_vars:
      excluded_tasks:
        - bootstrap
        - ssh
```

    and configure the extension as specified in config.yml, but won't
    create the node groups or try to join the nodes.
