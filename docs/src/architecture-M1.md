description: Configuring the M1 architecture with TPA.
---

# M1

A Postgres cluster with one or more active locations, each with the same
number of Postgres nodes and an extra Barman node. Optionally, there can
also be a location containing only a witness node, or a location
containing only a single node, even if the active locations have more
than one.

This architecture is suitable for production and is also suited to
testing, demonstrating and learning due to its simplicity and ability to
be configured with no proprietary components.

If you select subscription-only EDB software with this architecture
it will be sourced from EDB Repos 2.0 and you will need to 
[provide a token](edb_repositories.md).

## Application and backup failover

The M1 architecture implements failover management in that it ensures
that a replica will be promoted to take the place of the primary should
the primary become unavailable. However it *does not provide any
automatic facility to reroute application traffic to the primary*. If
you require, automatic failover of application traffic you will need to
configure this at the application itself (for example using multi-host
connections) or by using an appropriate proxy or load balancer and the
facilities offered by your selected failover manager.

The above is also true of the connection between the backup node and the
primary created by TPA. The backup will not be automatically adjusted to
target the new primary in the event of failover, instead it will remain
connected to the original primary. If you are performing a manual
failover and wish to connect the backup to the new primary, you may
simply re-run `tpaexec deploy`. If you wish to automatically change the
backup source, you should implement this using your selected failover
manager as noted above.

## Cluster configuration

### Overview of configuration options

An example invocation of `tpaexec configure` for this architecture
is shown below.

```shell
tpaexec configure ~/clusters/m1 \
         --architecture M1 \
         --platform aws --region eu-west-1 --instance-type t3.micro \
         --distribution Debian \
         --postgresql 14 \
         --failover-manager repmgr \
         --data-nodes-per-location 3
```

You can list all available options using the help command.

```shell
tpaexec configure --architecture M1 --help
```

The tables below describe the mandatory options for M1
and additional important options.
More detail on the options is provided in the following section.

| One of: <br> - `--failover-manager {efm, repmgr, patroni}`<br>- `--enable-efm`<br> - `--enable-repmgr`<br>- `--enable-patroni`  | Select the failover manager from [`efm`](efm.md), [`repmgr`](repmgr.md) and [`patroni`](patroni.md).                                                  |

| `--location-names` | A space-separated list of location names. The number of active locations is equal to the number of names supplied, minus one for each of the witness-only location and the single-node location if they are requested. | A single location called "main" is used. |
| `--primary-location` | The location where the primary server will be. Must be a member of `location-names`. | The first listed location is used. |
| `--data-nodes-per-location` | A number from 1 upwards. In each location, one node will be configured to stream directly from the cluster's primary node, and the other nodes, if present, will stream from that one. | Defaults to 2.
| `--witness-only-location` | A location name, must be a member of `location-names`. | No witness-only location is added. |
| `--single-node-location` | A location name, must be a member of `location-names`. | No single-node location is added. |
| `--enable-haproxy`        | 2 additional nodes will be added as a load balancer layer.<br/>Only supported with Patroni as the failover manager. | HAproxy nodes will not be added to the cluster.                                                      |
