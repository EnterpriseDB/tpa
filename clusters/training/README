Training VMs
============

The process to request VMs for training is documented here:

    https://redmine.2ndquadrant.it/projects/courses/wiki/Virtual_Machines_for_training

Once a request has been received, e.g.,

    https://redmine.2ndquadrant.it/issues/10973

this is the process to create the required hosts.

1. Run "./generate-config.sh 10973 15 > config.yml" in clusters/training
   (10973 is the redmine issue, 15 is the number of hosts requested) to
   generate config.yml with the correct number of entries.

2. Run "bin/provision training -v" to provision the hosts on AWS EC2
   according to config.yml.

3. Run "bin/deploy training -v" to complete the deployment.

Once this is done, the following files should be provided to the
requestor:

1. ssh_config
2. known_hosts
3. id_training*
4. inventory/00-*
