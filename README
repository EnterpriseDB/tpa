This repository contains Ansible playbooks to provision, set up, and
operate replicated PostgreSQL servers on EC2.

provision.yml provisions three EC2 instances in different regions:

    ansible-playbook -i hosts provision.yml

configure.yml sets up these instances to run Postgres:

    ansible-playbook -i ec2.py configure.yml
