- summary: Add --force option to `tpaexec relink`
  description: |
    By default, relink doesn't modify targeted files if they already
    exist. With --force, relink removes all existing targeted files then
    recreates them.

    --force is needed to update AAP-enabled cluster directories after
    TPA package upgrade and is also useful for rescuing a cluster that
    has been broken by manual intervention.
