- summary: Add support for `postgres_wal_dir` in Patroni deployments
  description: |
    When a custom `postgres_wal_dir` is specified in TPA configuration, TPA will
    make sure to relay that option to the corresponding settings in the Patroni
    configuration file.

    That way, if Patroni ever needs to rebuild a standby on its own, out of TPA,
    the standby will be properly set up with a custom WAL directory.
