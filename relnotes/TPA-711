- summary: Add ip_address to the ip_addresses list
  description: |
    If the key `ip_address` is defined for a node, add a corresponding entry
    to `ip_addresses`. This ensures that TPA can correctly work out whether
    streaming is working correctly when re-running deploy on an existing cluster.

    This fixes error messages like "Unrecognised host=10.136.4.247 in
    primary_conninfo" for nodes with `ip_address` defined.
