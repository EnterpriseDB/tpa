- summary: Make barman-cli package subject to barman_package_version
  description: |
    If barman_package_version is set, TPA will now look at it when looking
    for the barman-cli package as well as for barman itself. This resolves
    an inconsistency which caused clusters using the downloader to fail when
    barman_package_version was used.
