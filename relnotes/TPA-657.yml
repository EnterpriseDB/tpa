- summary: Task selectors replace ansible tags
  description: |
    Selective execution of tasks is now supported using custom selectors
    rather than ansible tags.

    To run only tasks matching a certain selector:

      tpaexec deploy . --included_tasks=barman

    To skip tasks matching a certain selector:

      tpaexec deploy . --excluded_tasks=ssh

    Task selectors can also be used by specifying the `excluded_tasks` or
    `included_tasks` variables in config.yml .
