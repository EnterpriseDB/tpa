- summary: Add `pg_failover_slots` to recognized extensions
  description: |
    pg_failover_slots is a module, so CREATE EXTENSION cannot be run
    for its entry in either `postgres_extensions` or the list of
    extensions named under `postgres_databases`.

    A key-value pair of `module: true` is included with its entry in the
    `default_postgres_extensions_dictionary`.

    Logic is added to construct a list of extensions flagged `module`
    and remove the entries from the `postgres_extensions` and extensions
    under `postgres_databases` if necessary.

    The required package and shared_preload_library entry are included and
    CREATE EXTENSION is not run for `pg_failover_slots`.
