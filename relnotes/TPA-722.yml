- summary: Support configuring read-only endpoints on PGD proxy nodes
  description: |
    PGD version 5.5 allows for proxy nodes to be configured as read endpoints, 
    which direct read-only queries to a shadow node. TPA supports this configuration 
    option by setting a `read_listen_port` parameter under `default_pgd_proxy_options` 
    and `pgd_proxy_options` in `config.yml`. This parameter is included by default when 
    the PGD version is >= 5.5. 
    
    User's can also specify the port numbers by passing `--proxy-listen-port` 
    and `proxy-read-listen-port` arguments to the `tpaexec configure` command.
