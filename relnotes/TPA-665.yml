- summary: Avoid synchronizing database structure to PGD witness nodes
  description: |
    Currently, when creating a witness node, PGD will by default synchronize
    the source node's database structure. This is however not necessary
    and the synchronized schema will never be used or updated. To prevent
    this happening, explicitly set bdr.join_node_group()'s option
    "synchronize_structure" to "none" for witness nodes.
