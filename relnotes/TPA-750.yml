- summary: Force barman 3.9 when installing rpms from PGDG
  description: |
    To work around broken barman 3.10 packages in the PGDG repos, TPA
    now installs version 3.9 of barman if using PGDG repos on an
    RHEL-family system. This behaviour can be overridden by explicitly
    setting barman_package_version in config.yml .
  # Possible types: notable_change, minor_change, bugfix or breaking_change
  type: minor_change
  # At least one between jira_tickets or support_tickets must be defined. You
  # can define both if you want
  # You must have at least one list item in each *_tickets section that is
  # defined
  jira_tickets:
  - TPA-750
