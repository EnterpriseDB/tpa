- summary: Support choosing Ansible version
  description: |
    The `--ansible-version` argument to `tpaexec setup` now accepts `8` or `9`
    as valid ansible versions, as well as the existing `2q` or `community`, both
    of which imply ansible 2.9. The default is now `8`.

    Support for ansible 9 is experimental and requires python 3.10 or above.
