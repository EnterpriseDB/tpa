- summary: Change haproxy_bind_address when Patroni is failover_manager
  description: |
    The default_haproxy_bind_address value '127.0.0.1' does not allow for communication
    between Postgres nodes and haproxy nodes (namely invoking pg_isready). 
    The bind address is set to '0.0.0.0' when Patroni is the failover manager.
    Users should change this value to something more restrictive and 
    appropriate for their cluster networking.
