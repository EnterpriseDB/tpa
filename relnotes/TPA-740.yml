- summary: Fixed an issue whereby docker provisioning failed with "read-only file system"
  description: |
    On host systems running cgroup1 with docker containers running recent
    OS images, `tpaexec provision` could fail to provision containers
    with an error message like "mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/tpa.scope: read-only
    file system". TPA will now detect this case and avoid it.
