- summary: Add option to provision without deploying
  description: |
    If an instance has `provision_only: true` in config.yml, it will
    be provisioned as normal but not added to the inventory which is seen
    by `tpaexec deploy`.

    An example use for this is with a custom docker image to set up a
    testing environment.
