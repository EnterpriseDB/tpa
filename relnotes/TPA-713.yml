- summary: Various task selection fixes
  description: |
    Task selectors are now consistently applied in the final stage of
    deployment; in particular the 'post-deploy' selector is now supported.
    Consistency of task selectors in the tests is also improved and the
    examples of task selectors in the docs are now correct.
