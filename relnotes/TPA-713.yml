- summary: Various task selection fixes
  description: |
    Task selectors are now consistently applied in the final stage of
    deployment. Consistency of task selectors in the tests is improved
    and the examples of task selectors in the docs are now correct.

    All deploy-time hooks now have corresponding task selectors.
