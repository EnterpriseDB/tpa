- summary: Support Keyring for cluster vault password storage
  description: |
    Add support for system keyring to store cluster vault password by
    default. This leverages python keyring module to store vault
    password in the supported system keyring when `keyring_backend` is
    set to `system` (default for new clusters). This change does not
    impact existing clusters or any clusters that set `keyring_backend`
    to `legacy` in config.yml. `vault_name` setting in config.yml is
    used in combination with `cluster_name` to ensure uniqueness to
    allow provisioning for multiple clusters that all use the same
    `cluster_name` setting. Refer to tpaexec-configure.md for details.
