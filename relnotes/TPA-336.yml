- summary: Add useful extensions by default when role is pem-agent
  description: |
    The `sql_profiler`, `edb_wait_states` and `query_advisor` extensions
    are automatically included for any `pem-agent` node.

    The list of default extensions for pem-agent nodes is overridable by
    including a list of `pemagent_extensions` in config.yml.

    If this list is empty, no extensions will be automatically included.
