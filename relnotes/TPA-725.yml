- summary: Allow the user to choose between `edb-patroni` and `patroni` packages
  description: |
    EDB now produces its own `edb-patroni` package instead of rebuilding the
    `patroni` packages from PGDG. As a consequence, TPA was changed to allow
    users to select between `patroni` and `edb-patroni` packages.

    The selection is made through the new TPA setting `patroni_package_flavour`,
    which can have one among the following values:

    * `edb`: Install `edb-patroni` (using EDB repositories). This requires the
      user to configure `edb_repositories` TPA setting;
    * `community`: Install `patroni` package (using PGDG repositories). This
       requires the user to configure `PGDG` repository in either
       `apt_repository_list`, `yum_repository_list` or `suse_repository_list`
       TPA settings, depending on the target operating system.

    Note that you can change the package flavour at any time. TPA is able to
    transparently migrate between flavours. You only need to make sure the
    appropriate repositories are configured.

    For TPA clusters which have no `patroni_package_flavour` set in the
    configuration file, TPA will attempt to infere the flavour based on the
    configured repositories. If EDB repos are configured, `edb` flavour is
    assumed, otherwise `community` flavour.
