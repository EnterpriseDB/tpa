- summary: Support cgroups v2 systems for the docker platform
  description: |
    TPA can now provision docker clusters on hosts running cgroups 2,
    for all systems except RHEL 7. On newer systems (RHEL 9 or Ubuntu 22.04),
    TPA will use cgroups 2 scopes for additional isolation between the host
    and the containers.
