# Given a cluster and an instance name, "rehydrates" the instance as
# described below:
#
# 1. Ensures that all extra volumes attached to the instance are tagged
#    correctly and set to not be deleted on termination of the instance.
# 2. Terminates the instance and waits for the operation to complete.
# 3. Provisions a replacement for the instance.
# 4. Redeploys software on the new instance.

# Example: utils/rehydrate test/cluster instancename
