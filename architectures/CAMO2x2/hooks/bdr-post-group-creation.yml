# At this point, we've created the BDR nodes and the node group.
#
# In earlier versions, we used this hook script to configure replication
# sets for BDR, but we now do this elsewhere. We retain this script only
# to avoid dangling symlinks from existing cluster directories after a
# TPAexec upgrade.
#
# To perform custom actions after group creation, just remove the
# symlink and create your own bdr-post-group-creation.yml
