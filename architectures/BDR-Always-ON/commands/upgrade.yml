# We must perform a minor-version update of Postgres and BDR on a
# running cluster while maintaining overall cluster availability.
#
# The cluster may comprise BDR primary, logical standby, and physical
# streaming replica instances; and pgbouncer+haproxy instances besides.
# Logical standby and physical replica instances can be updated without
# any special precautions. Just stop, update, start.
#
# For BDR primaries, we must first check if haproxy is routing traffic
# to them, and if so, redirect to another primary before stopping and
# upgrading this one.
#
# (We don't try to minimise the downtime on each instance by downloading
# the packages before stopping the server, but we should explore that in
# future as an optimisation. Although the architecture tolerates delays,
# we would prefer the downtime to be predictable rather than dependent
# on the whims of the network.)

  # that is different from the primary and could be done on a running
  # postgres instance? Maybe, but we don't recommend replicas drifting
  # in terms of configuration purely because a replica is supposed to
  # replace a primary in case of a failover.
