# This command performs upgrades for PGD-Always-ON clusters, including
# Postgres (minor versions only) and BDR (major: 4→5 or minor: 5.x→5.y)
# upgrades.
#
# Upgrading from BDR v4 to v5 means changing the cluster's architecture
# from BDR-Always-ON to PGD-Always-ON using `tpaexec reconfigure`, and
# then running `tpaexec upgrade`. Minor-version upgrades don't require
# any configuration changes.
#
# The overall process is similar either way:
#
# 1. Check that the cluster looks normal before doing anything.
# 2. Then, for each Postgres instance:
#    a. Fence the node (depending on the configuration)
#    b. Stop, update, and restart Postgres
#    c. Unfence the node if necessary
#    d. Install and configure new packages (again, depending on the
#       cluster's configuration)
#    e. Wait for the cluster to settle before moving on
# 3. Perform some additional tasks that are relevant only to major
#    version upgrades:
#    a. Repeat v5-specific BDR configuration, including:
#       i. Set node_kind for each instance
#       ii. Create node groups and set group options
#       iii. Create and configure proxies
#    b. Replace harp-proxy with pgd-proxy
#    c. Completely remove harp
# 4. Check that the cluster looks normal at the end
#
# Extra tasks relevant only to the BDR major version upgrade are made
# conditional on "bdr_major_version_upgrade" throughout.
